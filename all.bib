@article{Schmid-Burgk90,
	Abstract = {The paper reports the discovery of a 120 arcsec long jet of CO in OMC-1. The feature, which is redshifted up to 15 km s-1 from the ambient CO gas, was presumably ejected from CS3/FIR4 60 arcsec southwest of the Trapezium and 110 arcsec south of IRc2. It might be related to a local bipolar source recently found there in SiO. The jet has very narrow width (not greater than 8 arcsec) and shows no sign of angular divergence; its axis is a straight line. The matter is accelerated all along, with the largest accelerations observed on the central axis. Lower velocity material envelops the high-speed core. Halfway along the jet, there is a sharp break at which the higher velocities terminate abruptly. Beyond the break, acceleration continues without change of direction or strength; the flow's final disappearance might be caused by accelerative dilution. The jet is probably denser than the ambient cloud; its temperature (about 45 K) approaches ambient values. Blueshifted emission of narrow lateral extent is seen over the full length of the redshifted jet.},

@article{Henney07,
	Abstract = {Multiple optical outflows are known to exist in the vicinity of the active star formation region called Orion South (Orion-S). We have mapped the velocity of low-ionization features in the brightest part of the Orion Nebula, including Orion-S, and imaged the entire nebula with the Hubble Space Telescope. These new data, combined with recent high-resolution radio maps of outflows from the Orion-S region, allow us to trace the origin of the optical outflows. It is confirmed that HH 625 arises from the blueshifted lobe of the CO outflow from 136-359 in Orion-S, while it is likely that HH 507 arises from the blueshifted lobe of the SiO outflow from the nearby source 135-356. It is likely that redshifted lobes are deflected within the photon-dominated region behind the optical nebula. This leads to a possible identification of a new large shock to the southwest of Orion-S as being driven by the redshifted CO outflow arising from 137-408. The distant object HH 400 is seen to have two even further components, and these all are probably linked to either HH 203, HH 204, or HH 528. Distant shocks on the west side of the nebula may be related to HH 269. The sources of multiple bright, blueshifted Herbig-Haro objects (HH 202, HH 203, HH 204, HH 269, and HH 528) remain unidentified, in spite of earlier claimed identifications. Some of this lack of identification may arise from the fact that deflection in radial velocity can also produce a change in direction in the plane of the sky. The best way to resolve this open question is through improved tangential velocities of low-ionization features arising where the outflows first break out into the ionized nebula.

	Abstract = {In this Letter, we present sensitive millimeter SiO (J = 5-4; nu = 0) line observations of the outflow arising from the enigmatic object Orion Source I made with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The observations reveal that at scales of a few thousand AU, the outflow has a marked "butterfly" morphology along a northeast-southwest axis. However, contrary to what is found in the SiO and H2O maser observations at scales of tens of AU, the blueshifted radial velocities of the moving gas are found to the northwest, while the redshifted velocities are in the southeast. The ALMA observations are complemented with SiO (J = 8-7; nu = 0) maps (with a similar spatial resolution) obtained with the Submillimeter Array. These observations also show a similar morphology and velocity structure in this outflow. We discuss some possibilities to explain these differences at small and large scales across the flow.},

@article{Stanke07,
	Abstract = {We present results of 1.3 mm interferometric and single-dish observations of the center of the L1641-N cluster in Orion. Single-dish wide-field continuum and CO(2-1) observations reveal the presence of several molecular outflows driven by deeply embedded protostellar sources. At higher angular resolution, the dominant millimeter source in the cluster center is resolved into a pair of protostars (L1641-N MM1 and L1641-N MM3), each driving a collimated outflow, and a more extended, clumpy core. Low-velocity CO line-wing emission is spread widely over much of the cluster area. We detect and map the distribution of several other molecular transitions (13CO, C18O, 13CS, SO, CH3OH, CH3CN, and OCS). CH3CN and OCS may indicate the presence of a hot corino around L1641-N MM1. We tentatively identify a velocity gradient over L1641-N MM1 in CH3CN and OCS, oriented roughly perpendicular to the outflow direction, perhaps indicative of a circumstellar disk. An analysis of the energy and momentum load of the CO outflows, along with the notion that apparently a large volume fraction is affected by the multiple outflow activity, suggests that outflows from a population of low-mass stars might have a significant impact on clustered (and potentially high-mass) star formation.},

	Abstract = {Aims:To study the Herbig-Haro (HH) flows in L1641N, an active star formation region in the southern part of the Orion GMC and one of the most densely populated regions of HH objects in the entire sky. By mapping the velocities of these HH objects, combined with mid-IR observations of the young stars, the major flows in the region and the corresponding outflow sources can be revealed.   Methods: We have used the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) to observe two deep fields in L1641N, selected on the basis of previous shock studies, using the 2.12 mum transition of H2 (and a KS filter to sample the continuum) for a total exposure time of 4.6 h (72 min K_S) in the overlapping region. The resulting high-resolution mosaic (0.23 arcsec pixel size, 0.75 arcsec seeing) shows numerous new shocks and resolves many known shocks into multiple components. Using previous observations taken 9 yr earlier we calculate a proper motion map and combine this with Spitzer 24 mum observations of the embedded young stars.   Results: The combined H2 mosaic shows many new shocks and faint structures in the HH flows. From the proper motion map we find that most HH objects belong to two major bi-polar HH flows, the large-scale roughly North-South oriented flow from central L1641N and a previously unseen HH flow in eastern L1641N. Combining the tangential velocity map with the mid-IR Spitzer images, two very likely outflow sources are found. The outflow source of the eastern flow, L1641N-172, is found to be the currently brightest mid-IR source in L1641N and seem to have brightened considerably during the past 20 yr. We make the first detection of this source in the near-IR (K_S) and also find a near-IR reflection nebula pointing at the source, probably the illuminated walls of a cone-shaped cavity cleared out by the eastern lobe of the outflow. Extending a line from the eastern outflow source along the proper motion vector we find that HH 301 and HH 302 (almost 1 pc away) belong to this new HH flow.  Based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, operated on the island of 	La Palma jointly by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in the Spanish Observatorio 	del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.  This work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.},

	Abstract = {The Gaia mission has opened a new window into the internal kinematics of young star clusters at the sub-km s−1 level, with implications for our understanding of how star clusters form and evolve. We use a sample of 28 clusters and associations with ages from ∼1--5 Myr, where lists of members are available from previous X-ray, optical, and infrared studies. Proper motions from Gaia DR2 reveal that at least 75% of these systems are expanding; however, rotation is only detected in one system. Typical expansion velocities are on the order of ∼0.5 km s−1, and in several systems, there is a positive radial gradient in expansion velocity. Systems that are still embedded in molecular clouds are less likely to be expanding than those that are partially or fully revealed. One-dimensional velocity dispersions, which range from  to 3 km s−1, imply that most of the stellar systems in our sample are supervirial and that some are unbound. In star-forming regions that contain multiple clusters or subclusters, we find no evidence that these groups are coalescing, implying that hierarchical cluster assembly, if it occurs, must happen rapidly during the embedded stage.},

	Abstract = {Molecular outflows driven by protostellar cluster members likely impact their surroundings and contribute to turbulence, affecting subsequent star formation. The very young Serpens South cluster consists of a particularly high density and fraction of protostars, yielding a relevant case study for protostellar outflows and their impact on the cluster environment. We combined CO ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/803/1/22/apj509900ieqn1.gif] {$J=1-0$} observations of this region using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim{\'e}trique 30 m single-dish telescope. The combined map allows us to probe CO outflows within the central, most active region at size scales of 0.01--0.8 pc. We account for effects of line opacity and excitation temperature variations by incorporating 12 CO and 13 CO data for the J = 1 − 0 and J = 3 − 2 transitions (using Atacama Pathfinder Experiment and Caltech Submillimeter Observatory observations for the higher CO transitions), and we calculate mass, momentum, and energy of the molecular outflows in this region. The outflow mass-loss rate, force, and luminosity, compared with diagnostics of turbulence and gravity, suggest that outflows drive a sufficient amount of energy to sustain turbulence, but not enough energy to substantially counter the gravitational potential energy and disrupt the clump. Further, we compare Serpens South with the slightly more evolved cluster NGC 1333, and we propose an empirical scenario for outflow-cluster interaction at different evolutionary stages.},

@article{Offner18,
	Abstract = {A fundamental property of molecular clouds is that they are turbulent1, but how this turbulence is generated and maintained is unknown. One possibility is that stars forming within the cloud regenerate turbulence via their outflows, winds and radiation (`feedback')2. However, disentangling motions created by feedback from the initial cloud turbulence is challenging. Here, we confront the relationship between stellar feedback and turbulence by identifying and separating the local and global impact of stellar winds. We analyse magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which we track wind material as it interacts with the ambient cloud. By distinguishing between launched material, gas entrained by the wind and pristine gas we show energy is transferred away from the sources via magnetic waves excited by the expanding wind shells. This action at a distance enhances the fraction of stirring motion compared with compressing motion and produces a flatter velocity power spectrum. We conclude that stellar feedback accounts for significant energy transfer within molecular clouds---an impact enhanced by magnetic waves, which have previously been neglected by observations. Overall, stellar feedback can partially offset global turbulence dissipation.},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique to determine distances to major star-forming regions across the Perseus Molecular Cloud, using a combination of stellar photometry, astrometric data, and 12 CO spectral-line maps. Incorporating the Gaia DR2 parallax measurements when available, we start by inferring the distance and reddening to stars from their Pan-STARRS1 and Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry, based on a technique presented by Green et al. and implemented in their 3D ``Bayestar'' dust map of three-quarters of the sky. We then refine their technique by using the velocity slices of a CO spectral cube as dust templates and modeling the cumulative distribution of dust along the line of sight toward these stars as a linear combination of the emission in the slices. Using a nested sampling algorithm, we fit these per-star distance--reddening measurements to find the distances to the CO velocity slices toward each star-forming region. This results in distance estimates explicitly tied to the velocity structure of the molecular gas. We determine distances to the B5, IC 348, B1, NGC 1333, L1448, and L1451 star-forming regions and find that individual clouds are located between ≈275 and 300 pc, with typical combined uncertainties of ≈5%. We find that the velocity gradient across Perseus corresponds to a distance gradient of about 25 pc, with the eastern portion of the cloud farther away than the western portion. We determine an average distance to the complex of 294 $\pm$ 17 pc, about 60 pc further than the distance derived to the western portion of the cloud using parallax measurements of water masers associated with young stellar objects. The method we present is not limited to the Perseus Complex, but may be applied anywhere on the sky with adequate CO data in the pursuit of more accurate 3D maps of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood and beyond.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of spectroscopic and astrometric data from APOGEE-2 and Gaia DR2 to identify structures toward the Orion Complex. By applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm to the six-dimensional stellar data, we identify spatially and/or kinematically distinct groups of young stellar objects with ages ranging from 1 to 12 Myr. We also investigate the star-forming history within the Orion Complex and identify peculiar subclusters. With this method we reconstruct the older populations in the regions that are currently largely devoid of molecular gas, such as Orion C (which includes the sigma Ori cluster) and Orion D (the population that traces Ori OB1a, OB1b, and Orion X). We report on the distances, kinematics, and ages of the groups within the Complex. The Orion D group is in the process of expanding. On the other hand, Orion B is still in the process of contraction. In lambda Ori the proper motions are consistent with a radial expansion due to an explosion from a supernova; the traceback age from the expansion exceeds the age of the youngest stars formed near the outer edges of the region, and their formation would have been triggered when they were halfway from the cluster center to their current positions. We also present a comparison between the parallax and proper-motion solutions obtained by Gaia DR2 and those obtained toward star-forming regions by the Very Long Baseline Array.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the relationship between protostellar outflows and turbulence in molecular clouds. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations we focus on the hydrodynamics of multiple outflows interacting within a parsec scale volume. We explore the extent to which transient outflows injecting directed energy and momentum into a subvolume of a molecular cloud can be converted into random turbulent motions. We show that turbulence can readily be sustained by these interactions and it is possible to broadly characterize an effective driving scale of the outflows. We compare the velocity spectrum obtained in our studies with that of isotropically forced hydrodynamic turbulence finding that in outflow-driven turbulence a power law of the form E(k) vprop k -beta is indeed achieved. However, we find that a steeper spectrum beta ~ 2.74 is obtained in outflow-driven turbulence models than in isotropically forced simulations beta ~ 2.45. We discuss possible physical mechanisms responsible for these results as well as their implications for turbulence in molecular clouds where outflows will act in concert with other processes such as gravitational collapse.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of the Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS) technique to calculate the velocity power spectrum of turbulence in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in 21 cm emission. We present an updated version of the VCS technique that takes into account regular motions, which is an important factor in our SMC VCS analysis. We have obtained a velocity spectral index of -3.85, a cold phase sonic Mach number of 5.6, and an injection scale of 2.3 kpc. The spectral index is steeper than the Kolmogorov index, which is expected for shock-dominated turbulence. The injection scale of 2.3 kpc suggests that HI supershells or tidal interactions with the Large Magellanic Cloud are the dominant drivers of turbulence in this dwarf galaxy. This implies that turbulence may be driven by multiple mechanisms in galaxies and that galaxy-galaxy interactions may play an important role in addition to supernova feedback.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of atomic hydrogen in the Galactic plane is usually mapped using the Doppler shift of 21 cm emission line, and this causes the modification of the observed emission spectrum. We calculate the emission spectrum in velocity slices of data (channel maps) and derive its dependence on the statistics of velocity and density fields. We find that, (1) if the density spectrum is steep, i.e., n<-3, the large k asymptotics of the emissivity spectrum are dominated by the velocity fluctuations; and (2) the velocity fluctuations make the emission spectra shallower, provided that the data slices are sufficiently thin. In other words, turbulent velocity creates small-scale structure that can erroneously be identified as clouds. The effect of thermal velocity is very similar to the change of the effective slice thickness, but the difference is that, while an increase of the slice thickness increases the amplitude of the signal, the increase of the turbulent velocity leaves the measured intensities intact while washing out fluctuations. The contribution of fluctuations in warm H I is suppressed relative to those in the cold component when the velocity channels used are narrower than the warm H I thermal velocity and small angular scale fluctuations are measured. We calculate how the spectra vary with the change of velocity slice thickness and show that the observational 21 cm data is consistent with the explanation that the intensity fluctuations within individual channel maps are generated by turbulent velocity fields. As the thickness of velocity slices increases, density fluctuations begin to dominate emissivity. This allows us to disentangle velocity and density statistics. The application of our technique to Galactic and SMC data reveals spectra of density and velocity with power law indexes close to -11/3. This is a Kolmogorov index, but the explanation of the spectrum as due to the Kolmogorov-type cascade faces substantial difficulties. We generalize our treatment for the case of a statistical study of turbulence inside individual clouds. The mathematical machinery developed is applicable to other emission lines.},

	Abstract = {We discuss a long-standing problem of how turbulence can be studied using observations of Doppler broadened emission and absorption lines. The focus of the present review is on two new techniques, the Velocity-Channel Analysis (VCA), which makes use of the channel maps, and the Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS), which utilizes the fluctuations measured along the velocity axis of the Position-Position Velocity (PPV) data cubes. Both techniques have solid theoretical foundations based on analytical calculations as well as on numerical testings. Among the two the VCS, which has been developed quite recently, has two unique features. First of all, it is applicable to turbulent volumes that are not spatially resolved. Second, it can be used with absorption lines that do not provide good spatial sampling of different lags over the image of the turbulent object. In fact, recent studies show that measurements of absorption line along less than 10 absorption directions are sufficient for a reliable recovering of the underlying spectrum of the turbulence. Moreover, both weak absorption lines and absorption lines in saturated regime can be used, which extends the applicability of the technique. Our comparison of the VCA and the VCS with a more traditional technique of Velocity Centroids shows that the former two techniques recover reliably the spectra of supersonic turbulence, while the Velocity Centroids may be used only for studying subsonic turbulence. We discuss spectra of astrophysical turbulence obtained with the VCA and the VCS techniques.},

	Abstract = {We utilize observations of sub-millimeter rotational transitions of CO from a Herschel Cycle 2 open time program (``COPS'', PI: J. Green) to identify previously predicted turbulent dissipation by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in molecular clouds. We find evidence of the shocks expected for dissipation of MHD turbulence in material not associated with any protostar. Two models fit about equally well: model 1 has a density of 103 cm-3, a shock velocity of 3 km s-1, and a magnetic field strength of 4 muG model 2 has a density of 103.5 cm-3, a shock velocity of 2 km s-1, and a magnetic field strength of 8 muG. Timescales for decay of turbulence in this region are comparable to crossing times. Transitions of CO up to J of 8, observed close to active sites of star formation, but not within outflows, can trace turbulent dissipation of shocks stirred by formation processes. Although the transitions are difficult to detect at individual positions, our Herschel-SPIRE survey of protostars provides a grid of spatially distributed spectra within molecular clouds. We averaged all spatial positions away from known outflows near seven protostars. We find significant agreement with predictions of models of turbulent dissipation in slightly denser (103.5 cm-3) material with a stronger magnetic field (24 muG) than in the general molecular cloud.},

@article{Lazarian04,
	Abstract = {A quantitative description of the statistics of intensity fluctuations within spectral line data cubes introduced in our earlier work is extended to the absorbing media. The possibility of extracting three-dimensional velocity and density statistics from both integrated line intensity and the individual channel maps is analyzed. We find that absorption enables the velocity effects to be seen even if the spectral line is integrated over frequencies. This regime, which is frequently employed in observations, is characterized by a nontrivial relation between the spectral index of velocities and the spectral index of intensity fluctuations. For instance, when density is dominated by fluctuations at large scales, i.e., when correlations scale as r-gamma, gamma<0, the intensity fluctuations exhibit a universal spectrum of fluctuations ~K-3 over a range of scales. When small-scale fluctuations of density contain most of the energy, i.e., when correlations scale as r-gamma, gamma>0, the resulting spectrum of the integrated lines depends on the scaling of the underlying density and scales as K-3+gamma. We show that if we take spectral line slices that are sufficiently thin, we recover our earlier results for thin-slice data without absorption. As a result, we extend the velocity channel analysis (VCA) technique to optically thick lines, enabling studies of turbulence in molecular clouds. In addition, the mathematical machinery developed enables a quantitative approach to solving other problems that involved statistical description of turbulence within emitting and absorbing gas.},

@article{McLeod18,
	Abstract = {Highly collimated parsec-scale jets, which are generally linked to the presence of an accretion disk, are commonly observed in low-mass young stellar objects. In the past two decades, a few of these jets have been directly (or indirectly) observed from higher-mass (larger than eight solar masses) young stellar objects, adding to the growing evidence that disk-mediated accretion also occurs in high-mass stars, the formation mechanism of which is still poorly understood. Of the observed jets from massive young stars, none is in the optical regime (massive young stars are typically highly obscured by their natal material), and none is found outside of the Milky Way. Here we report observations of HH 1177, an optical ionized jet that originates from a massive young stellar object located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The jet is highly collimated over its entire measured length of at least ten parsecs and has a bipolar geometry. The presence of a jet indicates ongoing, disk-mediated accretion and, together with the high degree of collimation, implies that this system is probably formed through a scaled-up version of the formation mechanism of low-mass stars. We conclude that the physics that govern jet launching and collimation is independent of stellar mass.},

	Abstract = {We present a study on the impact of molecular outflows in the Perseus molecular cloud complex using the COMPLETE Survey large-scale 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) maps. We used three-dimensional isosurface models generated in right ascension-declination-velocity space to visualize the maps. This rendering of the molecular line data allowed for a rapid and efficient way to search for molecular outflows over a large (~16 deg2) area. Our outflow-searching technique detected previously known molecular outflows as well as new candidate outflows. Most of these new outflow-related high-velocity features lie in regions that have been poorly studied before. These new outflow candidates more than double the amount of outflow mass, momentum, and kinetic energy in the Perseus cloud complex. Our results indicate that outflows have significant impact on the environment immediately surrounding localized regions of active star formation, but lack the energy needed to feed the observed turbulence in the entire Perseus complex. This implies that other energy sources, in addition to protostellar outflows, are responsible for turbulence on a global cloud scale in Perseus. We studied the impact of outflows in six regions with active star formation within Perseus of sizes in the range of 1-4 pc. We find that outflows have enough power to maintain the turbulence in these regions and enough momentum to disperse and unbind some mass from them. We found no correlation between outflow strength and star formation efficiency (SFE) for the six different regions we studied, contrary to results of recent numerical simulations. The low fraction of gas that potentially could be ejected due to outflows suggests that additional mechanisms other than cloud dispersal by outflows are needed to explain low SFEs in clusters.},

@article{Padoan01,
	Abstract = {The effects of noise and sampling on the spectral correlation function (SCF) introduced by Rosolowsky and coworkers are studied using observational data, numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, and simple models of Gaussian spectral line profiles. The most significant innovations of this paper are (1) the normalization of the SCF based on an analytic model for the effect of noise and (2) the computation of the SCF as a function of the spatial lag between spectra within a map. A new definition of the ``quality'' of a spectrum, Q, is introduced, which is correlated with the usual definition of signal-to-noise ratio. The prenormalization value of the SCF is a function of Q. We derive analytically the effect of noise on the SCF, and then normalize the SCF to its analytic approximation. By computing the dependence of the SCF on the spatial lag, S0(Deltar), we have been able to conclude the following: (1) S0(Deltar) is a power law, with slope alpha, in the range of scales li<l<lo. (2) The correlation outer scale, lo, is determined by the size of the map, and no evidence for a true departure from self-similarity on large scales has been found. (3) The correlation inner scale, li, is a true estimate of the smallest self-similar scale in a map. (4) The spectral slope, alpha, in a given region, is independent of velocity resolution (above a minimum resolution threshold), spatial resolution, and average spectrum quality. (5) Molecular transitions that trace higher gas density yield larger values of alpha (steeper slopes) than transitions tracing lower gas density. (6) Nyquist sampling, bad pixels in detector arrays, and reference-sharing data acquisition need to be taken into account for a correct determination of the SCF at Deltar=1. The value of alpha, however, can be computed correctly without a detailed knowledge of observational procedures.},

	Abstract = {The ``spectral correlation function'' analysis we introduce in this paper is a new tool for analyzing spectral line data cubes. Our initial tests, carried out on a suite of observed and simulated data cubes, indicate that the spectral correlation function (SCF) is likely to be a more discriminating statistic than other statistical methods normally applied. The SCF is a measure of similarity between neighboring spectra in the data cube. When the SCF is used to compare a data cube consisting of spectral line observations of the interstellar medium (ISM) with a data cube derived from MHD simulations of molecular clouds, it can find differences that are not found by other analyses. The initial results presented here suggest that the inclusion of self-gravity in numerical simulations is critical for reproducing the correlation behavior of spectra in star-forming molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new approach to comparing simulated observations that enables us to determine the significance of the underlying physical effects. We utilize the methodology of experimental design, a subfield of statistical analysis, to establish a framework for comparing simulated position-position-velocity data cubes to each other. We propose three similarity metrics based on methods described in the literature: principal component analysis, the spectral correlation function, and the Cramer multi-variate two-sample similarity statistic. Using these metrics, we intercompare a suite of mock observational data of molecular clouds generated from magnetohydrodynamic simulations with varying physical conditions. Using this framework, we show that all three metrics are sensitive to changing Mach number and temperature in the simulation sets, but cannot detect changes in magnetic field strength and initial velocity spectrum. We highlight the shortcomings of one-factor-at-a-time designs commonly used in astrophysics and propose fractional factorial designs as a means to rigorously examine the effects of changing physical properties while minimizing the investment of computational resources.},

	Abstract = {The multivariate tool of principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to 23 fields in the FCRAO CO Survey of the Outer Galaxy. PCA enables the identification of line profile differences, which are assumed to be generated from fluctuations within a turbulent velocity field. The variation of these velocity differences with spatial scale within a molecular region is described by a singular power law, deltav=cLalpha, which can be used as a powerful diagnostic to turbulent motions. For the ensemble of 23 fields, we find a mean value <alpha>=0.62+/-0.11. From a recent calibration of this method using fractal Brownian motion simulations (Brunt & Heyer), the measured velocity difference-size relationship corresponds to an energy spectrum, E(k), which varies as k-beta, where beta=2.17+/-0.31. We compare our results to both decaying and forced hydrodynamic simulations of turbulence. We conclude that energy must be continually injected into the regions to replenish that lost by dissipative processes such as shocks. The absence of large, widely distributed shocks within the targeted fields suggests that the energy is injected at spatial scales less than several parsecs.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate the capability of principal component analysis (PCA) as applied by Heyer & Schloerb to extract the statistics of turbulent interstellar velocity fields as measured by the energy spectrum, E(k)~k-beta. Turbulent velocity and density fields with known statistics are generated from fractional Brownian motion simulations. These fields are translated to the observational domain, T(x,y,v), considering the excitation of molecular rotational energy levels and radiative transfer. Using PCA and the characterization of velocity and spatial scales from the eigenvectors and eigenimages, respectively, a relationship is identified that describes the magnitude of line profile differences, deltav, and the scale, L, over which these differences occur, deltav~Lalpha. From a series of models with varying values of beta, we find alpha=0.33beta-0.05 for 1<beta<3. This provides the basic calibration between the intrinsic velocity field statistics to observational measures and a diagnostic for turbulent flows in the interstellar medium. We also investigate the effects of noise, line opacity, and finite resolution on these results.},

@article{Ungerechts97,
	Abstract = {We present a survey of the distribution of 20 chemical and isotopic molecular species along the central ridge of the Orion molecular cloud from 6' north to 6' south of BN-KL observed with the QUARRY focal plane array on the FCRAO 14 m telescope, which provides an angular resolution of ~50" in the 3 mm wavelength region. We use standard tools of multivariate analysis for a systematic investigation of the similarities and differences among the maps of integrated intensities of the 32 lines observed. The maps fall in three broad classes: first, those strongly peaked toward BN-KL second, those having rather flat distributions along the ridge; and third, those with a clear north-south gradient or contrast. We identify six positions or regions where we calculate relative abundances. Line velocities and line widths indicate that the optically thin lines generally trace the same volume of dense gas, except in the molecular bar, where C18O, C34S, H13CO+, CN, C2H, SO, and C3H2 have velocities characteristic of the bar itself, whereas the emission from other detected species is dominated by the background cloud. The strongest abundance variations in our data are the well-known enhancements seen in HCN, CH3OH, HC3N, and SO toward BN-KL and, less strongly, toward the Orion-South outflow 1.3 arcmin S.  The principal result of this study is that along the extended quiescent ridge the chemical abundances, within factors of 3-4, exhibit an impressive degree of uniformity. The northern part of the ridge has a chemistry closest to that found in quiescent dense clouds. While temperature and density are similar around the northern radical-ion peak near 3.5 arcmin N and in the southern core near 4.2 arcmin S, some abundances, in particular, those of the ions HCO+ and N2H+, are significantly lower toward 4.2 arcmin S.  The areas near 4.2 arcmin S and the molecular bar itself around (1.7 arcmin E, 2.4 arcmin S) stand out with peculiar and similar properties--probably caused by stronger UV fields penetrating deeper into the clumpy molecular gas. This leads to higher electron abundances and thereby reduced abundances of the ions, as well as a lack of complex molecules.},

	Abstract = {The multivariate statistical technique of principal component analysis (PCA) is described and demonstrated to be a valuable tool to consolidate the large amount of information obtained with spectroscopic imaging observations of the interstellar medium. Simple interstellar cloud models with varying degrees of complexity and Gaussian noise are constructed and analyzed to demonstrate the ability of PCA to statistically extract physical features and phenomena from the data and to gauge the effects of random noise upon the analysis. Principal components are calculated for high spatial dynamic range 12CO and 13CO data cubes of the Sh 155 (Cep OB3) cloud complex. These identify the three major emission components within the cloud and the spatial differences between 12CO and 13CO emissions. Higher order eigenimages identify small velocity fluctuations and therefore provide spatial information to the turbulent velocity field within the cloud. A size line width relationship deltav ~ Ralpha is derived from spatial and kinematic characterizations of the principal components of 12CO emission from the Sh 155, Sh 235, Sh 140, and Gem OB1 cloud complexes. The power-law indices for these clouds range from 0.42 to 0.55 and are similar to those derived from an ensemble of clouds within the Galaxy found by Larson (1981) and Solomon et al. (1987). The size-line width relationship within a given cloud provides an important diagnostic to the variation of kinetic energy with size scale within turbulent flows of the interstellar medium.},

	Abstract = {All molecular clouds are observed to be turbulent, but the origin, means of sustenance, and evolution of the turbulence remain debated. One possibility is that stellar feedback injects enough energy into the cloud to drive observed motions on parsec scales. Recent numerical studies of molecular clouds have found that feedback from stars, such as protostellar outflows and winds, injects energy and impacts turbulence. We expand upon these studies by analyzing magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds, including stellar winds, with a range of stellar mass-loss rates and magnetic field strengths. We generate synthetic 12CO(1-0) maps assuming that the simulations are at the distance of the nearby Perseus molecular cloud. By comparing the outputs from different initial conditions and evolutionary times, we identify differences in the synthetic observations and characterize these using common astrostatistics. We quantify the different statistical responses using a variety of metrics proposed in the literature. We find that multiple astrostatistics, including the principal component analysis, the spectral correlation function, and the velocity coordinate spectrum (VCS), are sensitive to changes in stellar mass-loss rates and/or time evolution. A few statistics, including the Cramer statistic and VCS, are sensitive to the magnetic field strength. These findings demonstrate that stellar feedback influences molecular cloud turbulence and can be identified and quantified observationally using such statistics.},

	Abstract = {We present a statistical framework to compare spectral-line data cubes of molecular clouds and use the framework to perform an analysis of various statistical tools developed from methods proposed in the literature. We test whether our methods are sensitive to changes in the underlying physical properties of the clouds or whether their behaviour is governed by random fluctuations. We perform a set of 32 self-gravitating magnetohydrodynamic simulations that test all combinations of five physical parameters - Mach number, plasma parameter, virial parameter, driving scales and solenoidal driving fraction - each of which can be set to a low or high value. We create mock observational data sets of 13CO(1-0) emission from each simulation. We compare these mock data to those generated from a set of baseline simulations using pseudo-distance metrics based on 18 different statistical techniques that have previously been used to study molecular clouds. We analyse these results using methods from the statistical field of experimental design and find that several of the statistics can reliably track changes in the underlying physics. Our analysis shows that the interactions between parameters are often among the most significant effects. A small fraction of statistics are also sensitive to changes in magnetic field properties. We use this framework to compare the set of simulations to observations of three nearby star-forming regions: NGC 1333, Oph A and IC 348. We find that no one simulation agrees significantly better with the observations, although there is evidence that the high Mach number simulations are more consistent with the observations.},

	Abstract = {The Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 region (hereafter, OMC-2/3) and the reflection nebula NGC 1977 encompass a section of the Orion A molecular cloud undergoing vigorous star forming activity.  One of the richest assemblages of protostars in the nearest 500 pc is seen in OMC-2/3, while NGC 1977 contains a cluster of over 100 young stars. In this review, we present a census of the protostars, pre-main sequence stars, and young brown dwarfs in these regions.  These are identified through sub-millimeter surveys, far-red to near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes, mid-infrared photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and X-ray observations made with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  We present an overview of the distribution of molecular gas associated with these regions and the rich complex of shock heated nebulae created by the young stars interacting with the molecular gas.  Finally, we discuss the relationship of OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977 to the neighboring Orion Nebula Cluster and the Orion OB1 association.},

	Abstract = {The second Gaia data release (GDR2) provides precise five-parameter astrometric data (positions, proper motions and parallaxes) for an unprecedented amount of sources (more than $1.3$ billion, mostly stars). The use of this wealth of astrometric data comes with a specific challenge: how does one properly infer from these data the astrophysical parameters of interest? The main - but not only - focus of this paper is the issue of the estimation of distances from parallaxes, possibly combined with other information. We start with a critical review of the methods traditionally used to obtain distances from parallaxes and their shortcomings. Then we provide guidelines on how to use parallaxes more efficiently to estimate distances by using Bayesian methods. In particular also we show that negative parallaxes, or parallaxes with relatively larger uncertainties still contain valuable information. Finally, we provide examples that show more generally how to use astrometric data for parameter estimation, including the combination of proper motions and parallaxes and the handling of covariances in the uncertainties. The paper contains examples based on simulated Gaia data to illustrate the problems and the solutions proposed. Furthermore, the developments and methods proposed in the paper are linked to a set of tutorials included in the Gaia archive documentation that provide practical examples and a good starting point for the application of the recommendations to actual problems. In all cases the source code for the analysis methods is provided. Our main recommendation is to always treat the derivation of (astro-) physical parameters from astrometric data, in particular when parallaxes are involved, as an inference problem which should preferably be handled with a full Bayesian approach.},

	Abstract = {We present a map of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of dust in the Orion complex. Orion is the closest site of high-mass star formation, making it an excellent laboratory for studying the interstellar medium and star formation. We use data from the Gaia-TGAS catalogue combined with photometry from 2MASS and WISE to get the distances and extinctions of individual stars in the vicinity of the Orion complex. We adopt the non-parametric method of Rezaei Kh. et al. (2017) to infer the probability distribution function of the dust densities at arbitrary points throughout the region. We map the dust distribution towards different parts of the Orion complex and find the distance and depth of the cloud compatible with other recent works which show the ability of the method to be applicable on the local molecular clouds to map their 3D dust distribution. We also demonstrate the danger of only using colours of stars to derive their extinctions without considering further physical constraints like the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD).},

	Abstract = {Stars form from the gravitational collapse of dense molecular cloud cores. In the protostellar phase, mass accretes from the core onto a protostar, likely through an accretion disk; and it is during this phase that the initial masses of stars and the initial conditions for planet formation are set. Over the past decade, new observational capabilities provided by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory have enabled wide-field surveys of entire star-forming clouds with unprecedented sensitivity, resolution, and infrared wavelength coverage. We review resulting advances in the field, focusing both on the observations themselves and the constraints they place on theoretical models of star formation and protostellar evolution. We also emphasize open questions and outline new directions needed to further advance the field.},

	Abstract = {We construct a semianalytic model to study the effect of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation on gas chemistry from embedded protostars. We use the protostellar luminosity function (PLF) formalism of Offner & McKee to calculate the total, FUV, and ionizing cluster luminosity for various protostellar accretion histories and cluster sizes. We2 compare the model predictions with surveys of Gould Belt star-forming regions and find that the tapered turbulent core model matches best the mean luminosities and the spread in the data. We combine the cluster model with the photodissociation region astrochemistry code, 3D-PDR, to compute the impact of the FUV luminosity from embedded protostars on the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, X CO, as a function of cluster size, gas mass, and star formation efficiency. We find that X CO has a weak dependence on the FUV radiation from embedded sources for large clusters owing to high cloud optical depths. In smaller and more efficient clusters the embedded FUV increases X CO to levels consistent with the average Milky Way values. The internal physical and chemical structures of the cloud are significantly altered, and X CO depends strongly on the protostellar cluster mass for small efficient clouds.},

	Abstract = {We measure H$_2$ temperatures and column densities across the Orion BN/KL explosive outflow from a set of thirteen near-IR H$_2$ rovibrational emission lines observed with the TripleSpec spectrograph on Apache Point Observatory's 3.5-meter telescope. We find that most of the region is well-characterized by a single temperature (~2000-2500 K), which may be influenced by the limited range of upper energy levels (6000-20,000 K) probed by our data set. The H$_2$ column density maps indicate that warm H$_2$ comprises 10$^{-5}$ - 10$^{-3}$ of the total H$_2$ column density near the center of the outflow. Combining column density measurements for co-spatial H$_2$ and CO at T = 2500 K, we measure a CO/H$_2$ fractional abundance of 2$\times$10$^{-3}$, and discuss possible reasons why this value is in excess of the canonical 10$^{-4}$ value, including dust attenuation, incorrect assumptions on co-spatiality of the H$_2$ and CO emission, and chemical processing in an extreme environment. We model the radiative transfer of H$_2$ in this region with UV pumping models to look for signatures of H$_2$ fluorescence from H I Ly$\alpha$ pumping. Dissociative (J-type) shocks and nebular emission from the foreground Orion H II region are considered as possible Ly$\alpha$ sources. From our radiative transfer models, we predict that signatures of Ly$\alpha$ pumping should be detectable in near-IR line ratios given a sufficiently strong source, but such a source is not present in the BN/KL outflow. The data are consistent with shocks as the H$_2$ heating source.},

To analyse the resulting wealth of data, we need automated tools to identify, classify, and quantify the important underlying structures. We present here a method for classifying and quantifying a pixelated structure, based on its principal moments of inertia. The method enables us to automatically detect, and objectively compare, centrally condensed cores, elongated filaments and hollow rings. We illustrate the method by applying it to (i) observations of surface-density from Hi-GAL, and (ii) simulations of filament growth in a turbulent medium. We limit the discussion here to 2D data; in a future paper we will extend the method to 3D data.},

@article{Pellegrini09,
	Abstract = {Previous work has shown the Orion Bar to be an interface between ionized and molecular gas, viewed roughly edge-on, which is excited by the light from the Trapezium cluster. Much of the emission from any star-forming region will originate from such interfaces, so the Bar serves as a foundation test of any emission model. Here we combine X-ray, optical, infrared (IR), and radio data sets to derive emission spectra along the transition from H+ to H0 to H2 regions. We then reproduce the spectra of these layers with a simulation that simultaneously accounts for the detailed microphysics of the gas, the grains, and molecules, especially H2 and CO. The magnetic field, observed to be the dominant pressure in another region of the Orion Nebula, is treated as a free parameter, along with the density of cosmic rays. Our model successfully accounts for the optical, IR, and radio observations across the Bar by including a significant magnetic pressure and also heating by an excess density of cosmic rays, which we suggest is due to cosmic rays being trapped in the compressed magnetic field. In the Orion Bar, as we had previously found in M17, momentum carried by radiation and winds from the newly formed stars pushes back and compresses the surrounding gas. There is a rough balance between outward momentum in starlight and the total pressure in atomic and molecular gas surrounding the H+ region. If the gas starts out with a weak magnetic field, the starlight from a newly formed cluster will push back the gas and compress the gas, magnetic field, and cosmic rays until magnetic pressure becomes an important factor.},

	Abstract = {All neutral atomic hydrogen gas and a large fraction of the molecular gas in the Milky Way Galaxy and external galaxies lie in PDRs, and PDRs are the origin of most of the nonstellar infrared (IR) and the millimeter CO emission from a galaxy. On the surfaces (A_v 1-3) of interstellar clouds, the absorption of far ultraviolet (FUV) photons (h_v 13.6 eV) by gas and dust grains leads to intense emission of [C II] 158 um, [O I] 63, 146 um, and H2 rovibrational transitions, as well as IR dust continuum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features. Deeper in PDRs, CO rotational and [C I] 370, 609 um lines originate. The transition of H to H2 and C+ to CO occurs within PDRs. Theoretical models compared with observations diagnose such physical parameters as the density and temperature structure, the elemental abundances, and the FUV radiation field in PDRs. Applications include clouds next to H II regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebulae, red giant outflows, circumstellar gas around young stars, diffuse clouds, the warm neutral medium (WNM), and molecular clouds in the interstellar radiation field: In summary, much of the interstellar medium in galaxies. This review focuses on dense PDRs in the Milky Way Galaxy. Theoretical PDR models help explain the observed correlation of the the CO J = 1-0 luminosity with the molecular mass and also suggest FUV-induced feedback mechanisms that may regulate star formation rates and the column density through giant molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {Far-UV photons (E<13.6 eV) from hot massive stars regulate, or at least influence, the heating, ionization, and chemistry of most of the neutral interstellar medium. Investigating the interaction between FUV radiation and interstellar matter thus plays an important role in astrochemistry. We have used ALMA to mosaic a small field of the Orion Bar where the critical transition from atomic to molecular gas takes place. These observations provide an unprecedented sharp view of this transition layer (~1" resolution or ~414 AU). The resulting images (so far in the rotational emission of CO, HCO+, H13CO+, SO+, SO, and reactive ions SH+ and HOC+) show the small-scale structure in gas density and temperature, and the steep abundance gradients. The images reveal a pattern of high-density substructures, photo-ablative gas flows and instabilities at the edge of the molecular cloud. We have also used the IRAM 30m telescope to carry out a line-survey of the illuminated edge of the Bar in the mm domain. Our observations reveal the presence of complex organic molecules that were not expected in such a harsh environment. In particular, we have reported the first detection of the unstable cis conformer of formic acid (HCOOH) in the ISM. The energy barrier to internal rotation (the conversion from trans to cis) is approximately 4827 cm-1. Hence, this detection is surprising. The low inferred trans-to-cis abundance ratio of 2.8+/-1.0 supports a photoswitching mechanism: a given conformer absorbs a FUV stellar photon that radiatively excites the molecule to electronic states above the interconversion barrier. Subsequent fluorescent decay leaves the molecule in a different conformer form. This mechanism, which we have specifically studied with ab initio quantum calculations, was not considered so far in astrochemistry although it can affect the structure of a variety of molecules in PDRs.

	Abstract = {The Orion Bar is the archetypal edge-on molecular cloud surface illuminated by strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. Our relative closeness to the Orion nebula (about 1,350 light years away from Earth) means that we can study the effects of stellar feedback on the parental cloud in detail. Visible-light observations of the Orion Bar show that the transition between the hot ionized gas and the warm neutral atomic gas (the ionization front) is spatially well separated from the transition between atomic and molecular gas (the dissociation front), by about 15 arcseconds or 6,200 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance). Static equilibrium models used to interpret previous far-infrared and radio observations of the neutral gas in the Orion Bar (typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an inhomogeneous cloud structure comprised of dense clumps embedded in a lower-density extended gas component. Here we report one-arcsecond-resolution millimetre-wave images that allow us to resolve the molecular cloud surface. In contrast to stationary model predictions, there is no appreciable offset between the peak of the H2 vibrational emission (delineating the H/H2 transition) and the edge of the observed CO and HCO+ emission. This implies that the H/H2 and C+/C/CO transition zones are very close. We find a fragmented ridge of high-density substructures, photoablative gas flows and instabilities at the molecular cloud surface. The results suggest that the cloud edge has been compressed by a high-pressure wave that is moving into the molecular cloud, demonstrating that dynamical and non-equilibrium effects are important for the cloud evolution.},

@article{Pety17,
	Abstract = {Context. Molecular lines and line ratios are commonly used to infer properties of extra-galactic star forming regions. The new generation of millimeter receivers almost turns every observation into a line survey. Full exploitation of this technical advancement in extra-galactic study requires detailed bench-marking of available line diagnostics.  Aims: We aim to develop the Orion B giant molecular cloud (GMC) as a local template for interpreting extra-galactic molecular line observations.  Methods: We use the wide-band receiver at the IRAM-30 m to spatially and spectrally resolve the Orion B GMC. The observations cover almost 1 square degree at 26'' resolution with a bandwidth of 32 GHz from 84 to 116 GHz in only two tunings. Among the mapped spectral lines are the , , C18O, C17O, HCN, HNC, , C2H, HCO+, N2H+(1-0), and , , SiO, c - C3H2, CH3OH (2-1) transitions.  Results: We introduce the molecular anatomy of the Orion B GMC, including relationships between line intensities and gas column density or far-UV radiation fields, and correlations between selected line and line ratios. We also obtain a dust-traced gas mass that is less than approximately one third the CO-traced mass, using the standard XCO conversion factor. The presence of over-luminous CO can be traced back to the dependence of the CO intensity on UV illumination. As a matter of fact, while most lines show some dependence on the UV radiation field, CN and C2H are the most sensitive. Moreover, dense cloud cores are almost exclusively traced by N2H+. Other traditional high-density tracers, such as HCN(1-0), are also easily detected in extended translucent regions at a typical density of  500 H2 cm-3. In general, we find no straightforward relationship between line critical density and the fraction of the line luminosity coming from dense gas regions.  Conclusions: Our initial findings demonstrate that the relationships between line (ratio) intensities and environment in GMCs are more complicated than often assumed. Sensitivity (I.e., the molecular column density), excitation, and, above all, chemistry contribute to the observed line intensity distributions, and they must be considered together when developing the next generation of extra-galactic molecular line diagnostics of mass, density, temperature, and radiation field.},

	Abstract = {Protostellar outflows have been shown theoretically to be capable of maintaining supersonic turbulence in cluster-forming clumps and keeping the star formation rate per free-fall time as low as a few percent. We aim to test two basic predictions of this outflow-regulated cluster formation model, namely, (1) the clump should be close to virial equilibrium and (2) the turbulence dissipation rate should be balanced by the outflow momentum injection rate, using recent outflow surveys toward eight nearby cluster-forming clumps (B59, L1551, L1641N, Serpens Main Cloud, Serpens South, rho Oph, IC 348, and NGC 1333). We find, for almost all sources, that the clumps are close to virial equilibrium and the outflow momentum injection rate exceeds the turbulence momentum dissipation rate. In addition, the outflow kinetic energy is significantly smaller than the clump gravitational energy for intermediate and massive clumps with M cl >~ a few × 102 M &sun;, suggesting that the outflow feedback is not enough to disperse the clump as a whole. The number of observed protostars also indicates that the star formation rate per free-fall time is as small as a few percent for all clumps. These observationally based results strengthen the case for outflow-regulated cluster formation.},

	Abstract = {We present high angular resolution (~1"), sensitive CO (2-1) line observations of the region OMC-1S in the Orion Nebula made using the Submillimeter Array. We detect the CO (2-1) high-velocity outflow that was first found by Rodr{\'\i}guez-Franco et al. with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Our observations resolve the outflow, whose velocity-integrated emission has a deconvolved width of 0.89"+/-0.06" (390 AU) and a projected length of ~48" (21,000 AU) with very high redshifted and blueshifted gas with velocities of about +/-80 km s-1. This outflow is among the most collimated (~3$\,^{\circ}$) and youngest outflows (600 yr) that have been reported. The data show that this collimated outflow has been blowing in the same direction during the last 600 years. At high velocities, the CO (2-1) outflow traces an extremely collimated jet, while at lower velocities, the CO emission traces an envelope possibly produced by entrainment of ambient gas. Furthermore, we also detect for the first time a millimeter wavelength continuum source associated with a class I protostar that we suggest could be the possible exciting source for this collimated outflow. However, the bolometric luminosity of this source appears to be far too low to account for the powerful molecular outflow.},

Upon analysis of the observed intensity profiles and the variations in angular size at different velocities, we conclude that a differentially expanding envelope, possibly the result of an explosive event, is the most likely explanation. The kinetic energy in the flow is 4 times 10 to the 47th ergs, based on a numerical model of the CO emission. The recently observed v = 1 to 0 radiation of H2 would arise from the shock front preceding the expanding gas.},

@article{Naze14,
	Abstract = {Magnetically confined winds of early-type stars are expected to be sources of bright and hard X-rays. To clarify the systematics of the observed X-ray properties, we have analyzed a large series of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, corresponding to all available exposures of known massive magnetic stars (over 100 exposures covering ~60% of stars compiled in the catalog of Petit et al.). We show that the X-ray luminosity is strongly correlated with the stellar wind mass-loss rate, with a power-law form that is slightly steeper than linear for the majority of the less luminous, lower-{\dot{M}} B stars and flattens for the more luminous, higher-{\dot{M}} O stars. As the winds are radiatively driven, these scalings can be equivalently written as relations with the bolometric luminosity. The observed X-ray luminosities, and their trend with mass-loss rates, are well reproduced by new MHD models, although a few overluminous stars (mostly rapidly rotating objects) exist. No relation is found between other X-ray properties (plasma temperature, absorption) and stellar or magnetic parameters, contrary to expectations (e.g., higher temperature for stronger mass-loss rate). This suggests that the main driver for the plasma properties is different from the main determinant of the X-ray luminosity. Finally, variations of the X-ray hardnesses and luminosities, in phase with the stellar rotation period, are detected for some objects and they suggest that some temperature stratification exists in massive stars' magnetospheres.  Based on data collected with XMM-Newton and Chandra.},

General trends among outflows are identified, and the most recent studies on the morphology, kinematics, energetics, and evolution of molecular outflows are discussed, focusing on results from high-resolution millimeter observations. We review the existing four broad classes of outflow models and compare numerical simulations with the observational data. A single class of models cannot explain the range of morphological and kinematic properties that are observed, and we propose a possible solution. The impact of outflows on their cloud is examined, and we review how outflows can disrupt their surrounding environment, through the clearing of gas and the injection of momentum and energy onto the gas at distances from their powering sources from about 0.01 to a few pc. We also discuss the effects of shock-induced chemical processes on the ambient medium, and how these processes may act as a chemical clock to date outflows. Finally, future outflow research with existing and planned millimeter and submillimeter instruments is presented.},

	Abstract = {We report 269 mid-infrared bubbles within 10$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic center from visual inspection of the Spitzer GLIMPSE II Legacy Science program images. The surface density of bubbles is ~5 deg-2 or about 3 times that detected in longitudes |l|=10deg-65$\,^{\circ}$, because the inner 10$\,^{\circ}$ of longitude were more thoroughly searched for small bubbles. There is a gradient in the number of bubbles with longitude with an increase of about a factor of 2 from 2$\,^{\circ}$ to 10$\,^{\circ}$ this is probably the result of several factors, including decreasing diffuse background brightness, confusion, and opacity with longitude. Bubble eccentricities are typically between 0.6 and 0.8, and >50% show evidence for blowouts, which we suggest result from local density fluctuations of the ISM and/or anisotropic stellar winds and radiation fields. The fraction of bubbles identified with H II regions and clusters is only about half that found at |l|>10deg. This is largely a result of the much smaller angular diameter of bubbles cataloged in the inner Galaxy than in the outer Galaxy. At least 12% of the bubbles have morphologies suggestive of triggered star formation. Most of the bubbles that show evidence for triggered star formation in the inner Galaxy have not formed secondary bubbles; it is postulated that this may be because they are too young to have had time for this to occur.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We derive physical properties such as the optical depths and the column densities of 13CO and C18O to investigate the relationship between the far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation and the abundance ratios between 13CO and C18O.  Methods: We have carried out wide-field (0.4 deg2) observations with an angular resolution of 25.8" (~0.05 pc) in 13CO (J = 1-0) and C18O (J = 1-0) toward the Orion-A giant molecular cloud using the Nobeyama 45 m telescope in the on-the-fly mode.  Results: Overall distributions and velocity structures of the 13CO and C18O emissions are similar to those of the 12CO (J = 1-0) emission. The optical depths of the 13CO and C18O emission lines are estimated to be 0.05 < tau13CO < 1.54 and 0.01 <tauC18O< 0.18, respectively. The column densities of the 13CO and C18O emission lines are estimated to be 0.2 × 1016< N13CO < 3.7 × 1017 cm-2 and 0.4 × 1015<NC18O< 3.5 × 1016 cm-2, respectively. The abundance ratios between 13CO and C18O, X13CO/XC18O, are found to be 5.7-33.0. The mean value of X13CO/XC18O in the nearly edge-on photon-dominated regions is found to be 16.47 $\pm$ 0.10, which is a third larger than that the solar system value of 5.5. The mean value of X13CO/XC18O in the other regions is found to be 12.29 $\pm$ 0.02. The difference of the abundance ratio is most likely due to the selective FUV photodissociation of C18O.  The data and the FITS files of Figs. 1, 2a,b, and 3a are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/564/A68},

@article{Churchwell06,
	Abstract = {A visual examination of the images from the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) has revealed 322 partial and closed rings that we propose represent partially or fully enclosed three-dimensional bubbles. We argue that the bubbles are primarily formed by hot young stars in massive star formation regions. We have found an average of about 1.5 bubbles per square degree. About 25% of the bubbles coincide with known radio H II regions, and about 13% enclose known star clusters. It appears that B4-B9 stars (too cool to produce detectable radio H II regions) probably produce about three-quarters of the bubbles in our sample, and the remainder are produced by young O-B3 stars that produce detectable radio H II regions. Some of the bubbles may be the outer edges of H II regions where PAH spectral features are excited and may not be dynamically formed by stellar winds. Only three of the bubbles are identified as known SNRs. No bubbles coincide with known planetary nebulae or W-R stars in the GLIMPSE survey area. The bubbles are small. The distribution of angular diameters peaks between 1' and 3' with over 98% having angular diameters less than 10' and 88% less than 4'. Almost 90% have shell thicknesses between 0.2 and 0.4 of their outer radii. Bubble shell thickness increases approximately linearly with shell radius. The eccentricities are rather large, peaking between 0.6 and 0.7; about 65% have eccentricities between 0.55 and 0.85.},

It contains identifications, ``basic data'', bibliography, and selected observational measurements for several million astronomical objects. Simbad is developed and maintained by CDS, Strasbourg. Building the database contents is achieved with the help of several contributing institutes. Scanning the bibliography is the result of the collaboration of CDS with bibliographers in Observatoire de Paris (DASGAL), Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, and Observatoire de Bordeaux. When selecting catalogues and tables for inclusion, priority is given to optimal multi-wavelength coverage of the database, and to support of research developments linked to large projects. In parallel, the systematic scanning of the bibliography reflects the diversity and general trends of astronomical research. A WWW interface to Simbad is available at: {http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/Simbad}.},

	Abstract = {We have calculated mass-loss rates for a grid of wind models covering a wide range of stellar parameters and have derived a mass-loss recipe for two ranges of effective temperature at either side of the bi-stability jump around spectral type B1. For a large sample of O stars, it is shown that there is now good agreement between these new theoretical mass-loss rates that take multiple scattering into account and observations. Agreement between the observed and new theoretical wind momenta increases confidence in the possibility to derive distances to luminous stars in distant stellar systems using the Wind momentum Luminosity Relation. For the winds of the B stars there is an inconsistency in the literature between various mass-loss rate determinations from observations by different methods. One group of dot {M} determinations of B stars does follow the new theoretical relation, while another group does not. The lack of agreement between the observed mass-loss rates derived by different methods may point to systematic errors in mass-loss determinations from observations for B stars. We show that our theoretical mass-loss recipe is reliable and recommend it be used in evolutionary calculations.},

The present appearance of the molecular gas supports the traditional concept of the evolution of the Orion Nebula, although this evolution has been more complex than that supposed by the classical view of the expansion of a uniform H II region into a uniform, neutral cloud. Inhomogeneities observable elsewhere in the cloud have allowed the H II region to break through the edge of the neutral cloud and expand freely, in directions which possess little molecular material. Speculations are also presented concerning the relationship between the shocks and star formation.},

	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array observations of V883 Ori, an FU Ori object. We describe the molecular outflow and envelope of the system based on the 12CO and 13CO emissions, which together trace a bipolar molecular outflow. The C18O emission traces the rotational motion of the circumstellar disc. From the 12CO blueshifted emission, we estimate a wide-opening angle of ˜150$\,^{\circ}$ for the outflow cavities. Also, we find that the outflow is very slow (characteristic velocity of only 0.65 km s-1), which is unique for an FU Ori object. We calculate the kinematic properties of the outflow in the standard manner using the 12CO and 13CO emissions. In addition, we present a P Cygni profile observed in the high-resolution optical spectrum, evidence of a wind driven by the accretion and being the cause for the particular morphology of the outflows. We discuss the implications of our findings and the rise of these slow outflows during and/or after the formation of a rotationally supported disc.},

	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the star-forming environment surrounding V1647 Ori, an outbursting FUor/EXor pre-MS star. Dust continuum and the (J = 2 - 1) $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O molecular emission lines were observed to characterize the V1647 Ori circumstellar disc and any large scale molecular features present. We detect continuum emission from the circumstellar disc and determine a radius r = 40 au, inclination i = 17$^{\circ}$$^{+6}_{-9}$ and total disc mass of M$_{\mathrm{disk}}$ of ~0.1 M$_{\odot}$. We do not identify any disc structures associated with nearby companions, massive planets or fragmentation. The molecular cloud environment surrounding V1647 Ori is both structured and complex. We confirm the presence of an excavated cavity north of V1647 Ori and have identified dense material at the base of the optical reflection nebula (McNeil's Nebula) that is actively shaping its surrounding environment. Two distinct outflows have been detected with dynamical ages of ~11,700 and 17,200 years. These outflows are misaligned suggesting disc precession over ~5500 years as a result of anisotropic accretion events is responsible. The collimated outflows exhibit velocities of ~2 km s$^{-1}$, similar in velocity to that of other FUor objects presented in this series but significantly slower than previous observations and model predictions. The V1647 Ori system is seemingly connected by an "arm" of material to a large unresolved structure located ~20$"$ to the west. The complex environment surrounding V1647 Ori suggests it is in the early stages of star formation which may relate to its classification as both an FUor and EXor type object.},

	Abstract = {We present a statistical study of the X-ray emission toward 22 Herbig AeBe stars (HAEBE) using the Chandra archive. We probe the origin of the X-rays toward Herbig stars: are they intrinsic?This question is addressed by correlations between the physical stellar properties and the X-ray emission. There is a weak correlation between the continuum radio emission at lambda = 3.6 cm and L X, which suggests that the X-ray emission depends upon the source. On the other hand, no correlation was found with the stellar rotational period, but that only excludes solar-like magnetic activity as the origin of the X-rays. Most importantly, the X-ray luminosity of HAEBE has a different distribution from that of T Tauri stars, suggesting that X-ray emission from an unseen late-type star companion can be ruled out with an 80% confidence level. This implies that the HAEBE must have magnetic activity. In addition, we report the observation of five sources for the first time, in three detections.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of X-ray emission by, and wind properties of, massive magnetic early B-type stars. Dedicated XMM-Newton observations were obtained for three early-type B-type stars, xi1 CMa, V2052 Oph and zeta Cas, with recently discovered magnetic fields. We report the first detection of X-ray emission from V2052 Oph and zeta Cas. The latter is one the softest X-ray sources among the early-type stars, while the former is one of the X-ray faintest. The observations show that the X-ray spectra of our programme stars are quite soft with the bulk of X-ray emitting material having a temperature of about 1 MK. We compile the complete sample of early B-type stars with detected magnetic fields to date and existing X-ray measurements, in order to study whether the X-ray emission can be used as a general proxy for stellar magnetism. We find that the X-ray properties of early massive B-type magnetic stars are diverse, and that hard and strong X-ray emission does not necessarily correlate with the presence of a magnetic field, corroborating similar conclusions reached earlier for the classical chemically peculiar magnetic Bp-Ap stars.  We analyse the ultraviolet (UV) spectra of five non-supergiant B stars with magnetic fields (tau Sco, beta Cep, xi1 CMa, V2052 Oph and zeta Cas) by means of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) iron-blanketed model atmospheres. The latter are calculated with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code, which treats the photosphere as well as the wind, and also accounts for X-rays. With the exception of tau Sco, this is the first analysis of these stars by means of stellar wind models. Our models accurately fit the stellar photospheric spectra in the optical and the UV. The parameters of X-ray emission, temperature and flux are included in the model in accordance with observations. We confirm the earlier findings that the filling factors of X-ray emitting material are very high.  Our analysis reveals that the magnetic early-type B stars studied here have weak winds with velocities not significantly exceeding vesc. The mass-loss rates inferred from the analysis of UV lines are significantly lower than predicted by hydrodynamically consistent models. We find that, although the X-rays strongly affect the ionization structure of the wind, this effect is not sufficient in reducing the total radiative acceleration. When the X-rays are accounted for at the intensity and temperatures observed, there is still sufficient radiative acceleration to drive a stronger mass-loss than we empirically infer from the UV spectral lines.},

	Abstract = {This is the first in a series of papers in which we describe and report the analysis of a large survey of Herbig Ae/Be stars in circular spectropolarimetry. Using the ESPaDOnS and Narval high-resolution spectropolarimeters at the Canada-France-Hawaii and Bernard Lyot Telescopes, respectively, we have acquired 132 circularly polarized spectra of 70 Herbig Ae/Be stars and Herbig candidates. The large majority of these spectra are characterized by a resolving power of about 65 000, and a spectral coverage from about 3700 {\AA} to 1 mum. The peak signal-to-noise ratio per CCD pixel ranges from below 100 (for the faintest targets) to over 1000 (for the brightest). The observations were acquired with the primary aim of searching for magnetic fields in these objects. However, our spectra are suitable for a variety of other important measurements, including rotational properties, variability, binarity, chemical abundances, circumstellar environment conditions and structure, etc. In this paper, we describe the sample selection, the observations and their reduction, and the measurements that will comprise the basis of much of our following analysis. We describe the determination of fundamental parameters for each target. We detail the least-squares deconvolution (LSD) that we have applied to each of our spectra, including the selection, editing and tuning of the LSD line masks. We describe the fitting of the LSD Stokes I profiles using a multicomponent model that yields the rotationally broadened photospheric profile (providing the projected rotational velocity and radial velocity for each observation) as well as circumstellar emission and absorption components. Finally, we diagnose the longitudinal Zeeman effect via the measured circular polarization, and report the longitudinal magnetic field and Stokes V Zeeman signature detection probability. As an appendix, we provide a detailed review of each star observed.},

	Abstract = {The origin of the magnetic fields in neutron stars, and the physical differences between magnetars and strongly magnetized radio pulsars are still under vigorous debate. It has been suggested that the properties of the progenitors of neutron stars (the massive OB stars), such as rotation, magnetic fields and mass, may play an important role in the outcome of core collapse leading to Type II supernovae. Therefore, knowing the magnetic properties of the progenitor OB stars would be an important asset for constraining models of stellar evolution leading to the birth of a neutron star. We present here the beginning of a broad study with the goal of characterizing the magnetic properties of main-sequence massive OB stars. We report the detection of two new massive magnetic stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster: Par1772 (HD36982) and NUOri (HD37061), for which the estimated dipole polar strengths, with 1sigma error bars, are 1150+320-200 and 620+220-170G, respectively.},

	Abstract = {HH 222 is a giant shocked region in the L1641 cloud, and is popularly known as the Orion Streamers or "the waterfall" on account of its unusual structure. At the center of these streamers are two infrared sources coincident with a nonthermal radio jet aligned along the principal streamer. The unique morphology of HH 222 has long been associated with this radio jet. However, new infrared images show that the two sources are distant elliptical galaxies, indicating that the radio jet is merely an improbable line-of-sight coincidence. Accurate proper motion measurements of HH 222 reveal that the shock structure is a giant bow shock moving directly away from the well-known, very young, Herbig Be star V380 Ori. The already known Herbig-Haro object HH 35 forms part of this flow. A new Herbig-Haro object, HH 1041, is found precisely in the opposite direction of HH 222 and is likely to form part of a counterflow. The total projected extent of this HH complex is 5.3 pc, making it among the largest HH flows known. A second outflow episode from V380 Ori is identified as a pair of HH objects, HH 1031 to the northwest and the already known HH 130 to the southeast, along an axis that deviates from that of HH 222/HH 1041 by only 3.$\,^{\circ}$7. V380 Ori is a hierarchical quadruple system, including a faint companion of spectral type M5 or M6, which at an age of ~1 Myr corresponds to an object straddling the stellar-to-brown dwarf boundary. We suggest that the HH 222 giant bow shock is a direct result of the dynamical interactions that led to the conversion from an initial non-hierarchical multiple system into a hierarchical configuration. This event occurred no more than 28,000 yr ago, as derived from the proper motions of the HH 222 giant bow shock.},

@article{Alecian09,
	Abstract = {In this paper we report the results of high-resolution circular spectropolarimetric monitoring of the Herbig Ae star V380 Ori, in which we discovered a magnetic field in 2005. A careful study of the intensity spectrum reveals the presence of a cool spectroscopic companion. By modelling the binary spectrum, we infer the effective temperature of both stars: 10500 +/- 500K for the primary and 5500 +/- 500K for the secondary, and we argue that the high metallicity ([M/H] = 0.5), required to fit the lines, may imply that the primary is a chemically peculiar star. We observe that the radial velocity of the secondary's lines varies with time, while that of the primary does not. By fitting these variations, we derive the orbital parameters of the system. We find an orbital period of 104 +/- 5d and a mass ratio (MP/MS) larger than 2.9. The intensity spectrum is heavily contaminated with strong, broad and variable emission. A simple analysis of these lines reveals that a disc might surround the binary and that a wind occurs in the environment of the system. Finally, we performed a magnetic analysis using the least-squares deconvolved profiles of the Stokes V spectra of both stars and adopting the oblique rotator model. From rotational modulation of the primary's Stokes V signatures, we infer its rotation period P = 4.31276 +/- 0.00042d and find that it hosts a centred dipole magnetic field of polar strength 2.12 +/- 0.15kG, with a magnetic obliquity beta = 66$\,^{\circ}$ +/- 5$\,^{\circ}$ and a rotation axis inclination i = 32$\,^{\circ}$ +/- 5$\,^{\circ}$. However, no magnetic field is detected in the secondary, and if it hosts a dipolar magnetic field, its strength must be below about 500G, to be consistent with our observations.

	Abstract = {The NGC 1999 reflection nebula features a dark patch with a size of  10 000 AU, which has been interpreted as a small, dense foreground globule and possible site of imminent star formation. We present Herschel PACS far-infrared 70 and 160 mum maps, which reveal a flux deficit at the location of the globule. We estimate the globule mass needed to produce such an absorption feature to be a few tenths to a few {M}&sun;. Inspired by this Herschel observation, we obtained APEX LABOCA and SABOCA submillimeter continuum maps, and Magellan PANIC near-infrared images of the region. We do not detect a submillimer source at the location of the Herschel flux decrement; furthermore our observations place an upper limit on the mass of the globule of 2.4×10-2 {M}&sun;. Indeed, the submillimeter maps appear to show a flux depression as well. Furthermore, the near-infrared images detect faint background stars that are less affected by extinction inside the dark patch than in its surroundings. We suggest that the dark patch is in fact a hole or cavity in the material producing the NGC 1999 reflection nebula, excavated by protostellar jets from the V 380 Ori multiple system.

Infrared observations of large numbers of young stars, as performed by the Spitzer Space Telescope, may advance our knowledge of this inherently complex process. While infrared data reveal the evolutionary status of the disk, they hold little information on the properties of the central star and the accretion characteristics.  Aims: Existing 2MASS and Spitzer archive data of the Lynds 1630N and 1641 clouds in the Orion GMC provide disk properties of a large number of young stars. We wish to complement these data with optical data that provide the physical stellar parameters and accretion characteristics.  Methods: We performed a large optical spectroscopic and photometric survey of the aforementioned clouds. Spectral types, as well as accretion and outflow characteristics, are derived from our VLT/VIMOS spectra. Optical SDSS and CAHA/LAICA imaging was combined with 2MASS, Spitzer IRAC, and MIPS imaging to obtain spectral energy distributions from 0.4 to 24 mum. Reddened model atmospheres were fitted to the optical/NIR photometric data, keeping Teff fixed at the spectroscopic value. Mass and age estimates of individual objects were made through placement in the HR diagram and comparison to several sets of pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. Results: We provide a catalog of 132 confirmed young stars in L1630N and 267 such objects in L1641. We identify 28 transition disk systems, 20 of which were previously unknown, as well as 42 new transition disk candidates for which we have broad-band photometry but no optical spectroscopy. We give mass and age estimates for the individual stars, as well as equivalent widths of optical emission lines, the extinction, and measures of the evolutionary state of the circumstellar dusty disk. We estimate mass accretion rates dot Macc from the equivalent widths of the Halpha, Hbeta, and He I 5876 {\AA} emission lines, and find a dependence of dot Macc ∝ M_*alpha, with alpha˜ 3.1 in the subsolar mass range that we probe. An investigation of a large literature sample of mass accretion rate estimates yields a similar slope of alpha˜ 2.8 in the subsolar regime, but a shallower slope of alpha˜ 2.0 if the whole mass range of 0.04 M&sun; <= M* <= 5 M&sun; is included. The fraction of stars with transition disks that show significant accretion activity is relatively low compared to stars with still optically thick disks (26 $\pm$ 11% vs. 57 $\pm$ 6%, respectively). However, those transition disks that do show significant accretion have the same median accretion rate as normal optically thick disks of 3-4 × 10-9 M&sun; yr-1. Analyzing the age distribution of various populations, we find that the ages of the CTTSs and the WTTSs with disks are statistically indistinguishable, the WTTSs without disks are significantly older than the CTTSs, and the ages of the transition disks and the WTTSs without disks are statistically indistinguishable. These results argue against disk-binary interaction or gravitational instability as mechanisms causing a transition disk appearance. Our observations indicate that disk lifetimes in the clustered population are shorter than in the distributed population. In addition to the spectroscopic sample analyzed in this paper, we provide a photometric catalog of sources detected in the optical and infrared, but without spectroscopic observations. As judged by their infrared colors, many of these are YSO candidates. In our survey we identify 2 new aggregates in L1641. We find 4 apparently subluminous objects with extremely high equivalent widths of Halpha and other emission lines, and 1 previously unknown FU Orionis object. We find that the low-density molecular cloud emission that surrounds the star-forming cores has significant substructure on scales of ⪅0.2 pc in L1641 but not in L1630. We propose refined Halpha equivalent width criteria to distinguish WTTSs from CTTSs in which the boundary EW is lowered significantly for late M spectral types.

	Abstract = {The giant Herbig-Haro object 222 extends over ˜6' in the plane of the sky, with a bow shock morphology. The identification of its exciting source has remained uncertain over the years. A non-thermal radio source located at the core of the shock structure was proposed to be the exciting source. However, Very Large Array studies showed that the radio source has a clear morphology of radio galaxy and a lack of flux variations or proper motions, favoring an extragalactic origin. Recently, an optical-IR study proposed that this giant HH object is driven by the multiple stellar system V380 Ori, located about 23' to the SE of HH 222. The exciting sources of HH systems are usually detected as weak free-free emitters at centimeter wavelengths. Here, we report the detection of an elongated radio source associated with the Herbig Be star or with its close infrared companion in the multiple V380 Ori system. This radio source has the characteristics of a thermal radio jet and is aligned with the direction of the giant outflow defined by HH 222 and its suggested counterpart to the SE, HH 1041. We propose that this radio jet traces the origin of the large scale HH outflow. Assuming that the jet arises from the Herbig Be star, the radio luminosity is a few times smaller than the value expected from the radio-bolometric correlation for radio jets, confirming that this is a more evolved object than those used to establish the correlation.},

Taken together with the 25 northern primaries studied by Henry and McCarthy (1990ApJ...350..334H) the fraction of binaries and triples within the now complete sample of all M dwarfs within 5pc is 9/34=26+/-9%, and the average number of companions per system is 0.32+/-0.10. This is lower by 2sigma than the observed multiplicity fraction of 43+/-5%, and companions per system of 0.49+/-0.05 in the sample of nearby solar-type main sequence stars. It is also much lower than the extrapolated binary fraction among young stars in Taurus. We discuss the implications of this finding.},

	Abstract = {We report on the first phase of a study of the stellar population comprising the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Approximately 50% of the ~ 3500 stars identified to date within ~ 2.5 pc of the namesake Trapezium stars are optically visible, and in this paper we focus on that sample with I < 17.5 mag. The large number and number density (npeak > 10(4) pc(-3) ) of stars, the wide range in stellar mass ( ~ 0.1-50 M_&sun;), and the extreme youth (< 1-2 Myr) of the stellar population, make the ONC the best site for investigating: 1) the detailed shape of a truly ``initial'' mass spectrum; 2) the apparent age spread in a region thought to have undergone triggered star formation; 3) the time sequence of star formation as a function of stellar mass; and 4) trends of all of the above with cluster radius. Nearly 60% of the ~ 1600 optical stars have sufficient data (spectroscopy and photometry) for placement on a theoretical HR diagram; this subsample is unbiased with respect to apparent brightness or cluster radius, complete down to ~ 1 M_&sun;, and representative of the total optical sample below ~ 1 M_&sun; for the age and extinction ranges characteristic of the cluster. Comparison of the derived HR diagram with traditional pre-main sequence evolutionary calculations shows a trend of increasing stellar age with increasing stellar mass. To avoid the implication of earlier characteristic formation times for higher-mass stars than for lower-mass stars, refinement of early evolutionary theory in a manner similar to the birthline hypothesis of Palla & Stahler (1993), is required. Subject to uncertainties in the tracks and isochrones, we can still investigate stellar mass and age distributions in the ONC. We find the ONC as a whole to be characterized by a mass spectrum which is not grossly inconsistent with ``standard'' stellar mass spectra. In particular, although there are structural differences between the detailed ONC mass spectrum and various models constructed from solar neighborhood data, the observed mass spectrum appears to a peak at ~ 0.2 M_&sun; and to fall off rapidly towards lower masses; several substellar objects are present. The abundance of low-mass stars relative to high-mass stars suggests that there is no bi-modal star formation mode; somewhat ironically, the ONC probably contains fractionally more low-mass stars than the solar neighborhood since the population not yet located on the HR diagram is dominated by sub-solar-mass stars. Nonetheless, the ONC mass spectrum is biased towards higher-mass stars within the innermost cluster radii (rprojected < 0.3 pc). We find the ONC as a whole to be characterized by a mean age of < 1 Myr and an age spread which is probably less than 2 Myr, but also by a bias towards younger stars at smaller projected cluster radii. Although the most massive stars and the youngest stars are found preferentially towards the center of the ONC it does not follow that the most massive stars are the youngest stars. A lower limit to the total cluster mass in stars is Mstars ~ 900 M_&sun; (probably a factor of < 2 underestimate). A lower limit to the recent star formation rate is ~ 10(-4) M_&sun; yr(-1) . All observational data in this study as well as stellar parameters derived from them are available in electronic format.},

	Abstract = {We report new spectral types or spectral classification constraints for over 600 stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) based on medium resolution (R ≈ 1500-2000) red optical spectra acquired using the Palomar 200'' and Kitt Peak 3.5 m telescopes. Spectral types were initially estimated for F, G, and early K stars from atomic line indices while for late K and M stars, which constitute the majority of our sample, indices involving TiO and VO bands were used. To ensure proper classification, particularly for reddened, veiled, or nebula-contaminated stars, all spectra were then visually examined for type verification or refinement. We provide an updated spectral type table that supersedes previous work, increasing the percentage of optically visible ONC stars with spectral type information from 68% to 90%. However, for many objects, repeated observations have failed to yield spectral types primarily due to the challenges of adequate sky subtraction against a bright and spatially variable nebular background. The scatter between our new and our previously determined spectral types is approximately two spectral sub-classes. We also compare our grating spectroscopy results with classification based on narrow-band TiO filter photometry, finding similar scatter. While the challenges of working in the ONC may explain much of the spread, we highlight several stars showing significant and unexplained bona fide spectral variations in observations taken several years apart; these and similar cases could be due to a combination of accretion and extinction changes. Finally, nearly 20% of ONC stars exhibit obvious Ca II triplet emission indicative of strong accretion.},

	Abstract = {We present a survey of the Orion A and B molecular clouds undertaken with the IRAC and MIPS instruments on board Spitzer. In total, five distinct fields were mapped, covering 9 deg2 in five mid-IR bands spanning 3-24 mum. The survey includes the Orion Nebula Cluster, the Lynds 1641, 1630, and 1622 dark clouds, and the NGC 2023, 2024, 2068, and 2071 nebulae. These data are merged with the Two Micron All Sky Survey point source catalog to generate a catalog of eight-band photometry. We identify 3479 dusty young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion molecular clouds by searching for point sources with mid-IR colors indicative of reprocessed light from dusty disks or infalling envelopes. The YSOs are subsequently classified on the basis of their mid-IR colors and their spatial distributions are presented. We classify 2991 of the YSOs as pre-main-sequence stars with disks and 488 as likely protostars. Most of the sources were observed with IRAC in two to three epochs over six months; we search for variability between the epochs by looking for correlated variability in the 3.6 and 4.5 mum bands. We find that 50% of the dusty YSOs show variability. The variations are typically small (~0.2 mag) with the protostars showing a higher incidence of variability and larger variations. The observed correlations between the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 mum variability suggests that we are observing variations in the heating of the inner disk due to changes in the accretion luminosity or rotating accretion hot spots.},

@article{Manoj02,
	Abstract = {We present optical spectra of four intermediate-mass candidate young stellar objects that have often been classified as Herbig Ae/Be stars. Typical Herbig Ae/Be emission features are not present in the spectra of these stars. Three of them, HD 36917, HD 36982 and HD 37062, are members of the young Orion nebula cluster (ONC). This association constrains their ages to be <~1Myr. The lack of appreciable near-infrared excess in them suggests the absence of hot dust close to the central star. However, they do possess significant amounts of cold and extended dust as revealed by the large excess emission observed at far-infrared wavelengths. The fractional infrared luminosities (Lir/L*) and the dust masses computed from IRAS fluxes are systematically lower than those found for Herbig Ae/Be stars but higher than those for Vega-like stars. These stars may thus represent the youngest examples of the Vega phenomenon known so far. In contrast, the other star in our sample, HD 58647, is more likely to be a classical Be star, as is evident from the low Lir/L*, the scarcity of circumstellar dust, the low polarization, the presence of Halpha emission and near-infrared excess, and the far-infrared spectral energy distribution consistent with free-free emission similar to other well-known classical Be stars.},

	Abstract = {A new up-to-date catalogue of Herbig Ae/Be (HAEBE) stars and related objects is certainly needed, for both well-seasoned researchers and, in particular, for new investigators starting to study the many interesting astrophysical properties of these very young objects. We present a brief discussion of the current observational characteristics that distinguish this class from their main sequence counterparts. The HAEBE and related stars are listed in five tables, containing 287 objects. Table 1 contains all Ae and Be stars which historically are recognized as true HAEBE stars or potential candidate members. Table 2 gives the stars of spectral type Fe, and emission line stars with very uncertain or unknown spectral type. In Table 3 are given all known Extreme Emission Line Objects (EELOs), of which most have not been identified to belong to any specific group. Table 4a and b list other Bep or B[e] stars with strong IR-excess and unknown spectral type. Table 5 contains the non-emission line possible young objects. Furthermore, Table 6 contains 35 stars rejected from former published lists of HAEBE stars. In these tables we are including coordinates, spectral types, visual magnitudes, ranges in photometric variability and references of several key publications related to each object. Relevant remarks, such as the presence of a nebula in the vicinity of an object, are also given.},

@article{Stelzer05,
	Abstract = {The X-ray properties of twenty ~1 Myr old O, B, and A stars of the Orion Trapezium are examined with data from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP). On the basis of simple theories for X-ray emission, we define two classes separated at spectral type B4: hotter stars have strong winds that may give rise to X-ray emission in small- or large-scale wind shocks, and cooler stars that should be X-ray dark due to their weaker winds and absence of outer convection zones where dynamos can generate magnetic fields. Emission by late-type magnetically active companions may be present in either class. Sixteen of the 20 stars are detected with a wide range of X-ray luminosities, logLX (ergs s-1)~29-33, and X-ray efficiencies, log(LX/Lbol)~-4 to -8. Only two stars, theta1 Ori D (B0.5) and NU Ori (B1), show exclusively the constant soft-spectrum emission at log(LX/Lbol)~-7 expected from the standard model involving many small shocks in an unmagnetized radiatively accelerated wind. Most of the other massive O7-B3 stars exhibit some combination of soft-spectrum wind emission, hard-spectrum flaring, and/or rotational modulation indicating large-scale inhomogeneity. Magnetic confinement of winds with large-scale shocks can be invoked to explain these phenomena. This is supported in some cases by nonthermal radio emission and/or chemical peculiarities, or direct detection of the magnetic field (theta1 Ori C). Most of the stars in the weak-wind class exhibit X-ray flares and logLX<31 ergs s-1, consistent with magnetic activity from known or unseen low-mass companions. In most cases, the X-ray spectra can be interpreted in terms of a two-temperature plasma model with a soft component of 3-10 MK and a hard component up to 40 MK. All nondetections belong to the weak-wind class. A group of stars exhibit hybrid properties-flarelike behavior superimposed on a constant component with logLX~32 ergs s-1-which suggest both magnetic activity and wind emission.},

	Abstract = {We present key results from the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey: spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and model fits of 330 young stellar objects, predominantly protostars, in the Orion molecular clouds. This is the largest sample of protostars studied in a single, nearby star formation complex. With near-infrared photometry from 2MASS, mid- and far-infrared data from Spitzer and Herschel, and submillimeter photometry from APEX, our SEDs cover 1.2-870 mum and sample the peak of the protostellar envelope emission at ˜100 mum. Using mid-IR spectral indices and bolometric temperatures, we classify our sample into 92 Class 0 protostars, 125 Class I protostars, 102 flat-spectrum sources, and 11 Class II pre-main-sequence stars. We implement a simple protostellar model (including a disk in an infalling envelope with outflow cavities) to generate a grid of 30,400 model SEDs and use it to determine the best-fit model parameters for each protostar. We argue that far-IR data are essential for accurate constraints on protostellar envelope properties. We find that most protostars, and in particular the flat-spectrum sources, are well fit. The median envelope density and median inclination angle decrease from Class 0 to Class I to flat-spectrum protostars, despite the broad range in best-fit parameters in each of the three categories. We also discuss degeneracies in our model parameters. Our results confirm that the different protostellar classes generally correspond to an evolutionary sequence with a decreasing envelope infall rate, but the inclination angle also plays a role in the appearance, and thus interpretation, of the SEDs.},

@article{Rubin11,
	Abstract = {We present Spitzer Space Telescope observations of 11 regions south-east (SE) of the Bright Bar in the Orion Nebula, along a radial from the exciting star theta1 Ori C, extending from 2.6 to 12.1 arcmin. Our Cycle 5 programme obtained deep spectra with matching Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) short-high (SH) and long-high (LH) aperture grid patterns. Most previous IR missions observed only the inner few arcmin (the `Huygens' Region). The extreme sensitivity of Spitzer in the 10-37 mum spectral range permitted us to measure many lines of interest to much larger distances from theta1 Ori C. Orion is the benchmark for studies of the interstellar medium, particularly for elemental abundances. Spitzer observations provide a unique perspective on the neon and sulphur abundances by virtue of observing the dominant ionization states of Ne (Ne+, Ne++) and S (S++, S3 +) in Orion and H II regions in general. The Ne/H abundance ratio is especially well determined, with a value of (1.02 $\pm$ 0.02) × 10-4 or in terms of the conventional expression, 12 + log(Ne/H) = 8.01 $\pm$ 0.01.  We obtained corresponding new ground-based spectra at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). These optical data are used to estimate the electron temperature, electron density, optical extinction and the S+/S++ ionization ratio at each of our Spitzer positions. That permits an adjustment for the total gas-phase sulphur abundance because no S+ line is observed by Spitzer. The gas-phase S/H abundance ratio is (7.68 $\pm$ 0.25) × 10-6 or 12 + log(S/H) = 6.89 $\pm$ 0.02. The Ne/S abundance ratio may be determined even when the weaker hydrogen line, H(7-6) here, is not measured. The mean value, adjusted for the optical S+/S++ ratio, is Ne/S =13.0 $\pm$ 0.2.  We derive the electron density (Ne) versus distance from theta1 Ori C for [S III] (Spitzer) and [S II] (CTIO). Both distributions are for the most part decreasing with increasing distance. The values for Ne[S II] fall below those of Ne[S III] at a given distance except for the outermost position. This general trend is consistent with the commonly accepted blister model for the Orion Nebula. The natural shape of such a blister is concave with an underlying decrease in density with increasing distance from the source of photoionization.  Our spectra are the deepest ever taken in these outer regions of Orion over the 10-37 mum range. Tracking the changes in ionization structure via the line emission to larger distances provides much more leverage for understanding the far less studied outer regions. A dramatic find is the presence of high-ionization Ne++ all the way to the outer optical boundary ˜12 arcmin from theta1 Ori C. This IR result is robust, whereas the optical evidence from observations of high-ionization species (e.g. O++) at the outer optical boundary suffers uncertainty because of scattering of emission from the much brighter inner Huygens Region. The Spitzer spectra are consistent with the Bright Bar being a high-density `localized escarpment' in the larger Orion Nebula picture. Hard ionizing photons reach most solid angles well SE of the Bright Bar. The so-called Orion foreground `Veil', seen prominently in projection at our outermost position 12 arcmin from theta1 Ori C, is likely an H II region-photo-dissociation region (PDR) interface. The Spitzer spectra show very strong enhancements of PDR lines -[Si II] 34.8 mum, [Fe II] 26.0 mum and molecular hydrogen - at the outermost position.},

	Abstract = {Using the KOSMA 3 m telescope, 54 Herbig Ae/Be (HAe/Be) stars were surveyed in CO and 13CO emission lines. The properties of the stars and their circumstellar environments were studied by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The mean line width of 13CO (2-1) lines of this sample is 1.87 km s-1. The average column density of H2 is found to be 4.9 × 1021 cm-2 for stars younger than 106 yr, while this drops to 2.5 × 1021 cm-2 for those older than 106 yr. No significant difference is found among the SEDs of HAe and HBe stars of the same age. Infrared excess decreases with age, envelope masses and envelope accretion rates decease with age after 105 yr, the average disk mass of the sample is 3.3 × 10-2 M sun, the disk accretion rate decreases more slowly than the envelope accretion rate, and a strong correlation between the CO line intensity and the envelope mass is found.},

	Abstract = {The results of a radio mapping of the high velocity molecular gas in NGC 2071, GL 490, and S 140 in the J = 1-0 transition of CO at an angular resolution of 48 arcsec, and the J = 2-1 CO transition of gas in NGC 2071 and Orion at 23 arcsec resolution are reported. The sources in NGC 2071 and GL 490 were bipolar, with the 2071 outflows being collimated in two opposing jets. The magnitudes of the high velocity emissions were all functions of the velocities. The mean optical depths range from 1-5, with the Orion CO/C-130 line intensity being nearly 74, implying an isotopic intensity ratio close to terrestrial levels. The excitation temperature was 90 K in Orion, 15 K in the others, with the ambient gas clouds being at least as hot as the flow gases. The molecular outflows are judged to originate in a cavity swept out by a stellar wind; the configurations arise from the interaction of a collimated stellar wind with the surrounding stellar cloud. Instrumental resolution was not sufficient to observe the source object(s).},

	Abstract = {X-rays from massive stars are ubiquitous yet not clearly understood. In an XMM-Newton observation devoted to observing the first site of star formation in the rho Ophiuchi dark cloud, we detect smoothly variable X-ray emission from the B2IV+B2V system of rho Ophiuchi. We tentatively assign the emission to the primary component. The light curve of the pn camera shows a first phase of low, almost steady rate, then a rise phase of duration of 10 ks, followed by a high rate phase. The variability is seen primarily in the band 1.0-8.0 keV while little variability is detected below 1 keV. The spectral analysis of the three phases reveals the presence of a hot component at 3.0 keV that adds up to two relatively cold components at 0.9 keV and 2.2 keV. We explain the smooth variability with the emergence of an extended active region on the surface of the primary star as being due to its fast rotation (vsin i ~ 315 km s-1). We estimate that the region has a diameter in the range 0.5-0.6 R*. The hard X-ray emission and its variability hint at a magnetic origin, as suggested for a few other late-O through early-B type stars. We also discuss an alternative explanation based on the emergence from occultation of a young (5-10 Myr) low mass companion that is bright and hot in X-rays.},

	Abstract = {We develop the use of the population diagram method to analyze molecular emission in order to derive physical properties of interstellar clouds. We focus particular attention on how the optical depth affects the derived total column density and the temperature. We derive an optical depth correction factor that can be evaluated based on observations and that incorporates the effect of saturation on derived upper level populations. We present analytic results for linear molecules in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We investigate numerically how subthermal excitation influences the population diagram technique, studying how the determination of kinetic temperature is affected when the local density is insufficient to achieve LTE. We present results for HC3N and CH3OH, representative of linear and nonlinear molecules, respectively. In some cases, alternative interpretations to the standard optically thin and thermalized picture yield significantly different results for column density and kinetic temperature, and we discuss this behavior. The population diagram method can be a very powerful tool for determining physical conditions in dense clouds if proper recognition is given to effects of saturation and subthermal excitation. We argue that the population diagram technique is, in fact, superior to fitting intensities of different transitions directly, and we indicate how it can be effectively employed.},

The molecular outflow sources identified include all previously known molecular outflows and, reported for the first time, three additional molecular outflows. None of the observed molecular outflows appear to be oriented along a preferred direction, and they are also distributed nonuniformly throughout the L1641 region. Maps of the molecular outflows suggest that the direction of the molecular outflow may be shaped by the ambient molecular cloud. The estimated momentum of the observed molecular outflows is found to be sufficient to support the molecular cloud over the dissipation time scale against gravitational collapse.},

@article{ZhangY16,
	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array Cycle 1 observations of the HH 46/47 molecular outflow using combined 12 m array and Atacama Compact Array observations. The improved angular resolution and sensitivity of our multi-line maps reveal structures that help us study the entrainment process in much more detail and allow us to obtain more precise estimates of outflow properties than in previous observations. We use {}13{{CO}} (1-0) and {{{C}}}18{{O}} (1-0) emission to correct for the {}12{{CO}} (1-0) optical depth to accurately estimate the outflow mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. This correction increases the estimates of the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy by factors of about 9, 5, and 2, respectively, with respect to estimates assuming optically thin emission. The new {}13{{CO}} and {{{C}}}18{{O}} data also allow us to trace denser and slower outflow material than that traced by the {}12{{CO}} maps, and they reveal an outflow cavity wall at very low velocities (as low as 0.2 {\text{km s}}-1 with respect to the core's central velocity). Adding the slower material traced only by {}13{{CO}} and {{{C}}}18{{O}}, there is another factor of three increase in the mass estimate and 50% increase in the momentum estimate. The estimated outflow properties indicate that the outflow is capable of dispersing the parent core within the typical lifetime of the embedded phase of a low-mass protostar and that it is responsible for a core-to-star efficiency of 1/4 to 1/3. We find that the outflow cavity wall is composed of multiple shells associated with a series of jet bow-shock events. Within about 3000 au of the protostar the {}13{{CO}} and {{{C}}}18{{O}} emission trace a circumstellar envelope with both rotation and infall motions, which we compare with a simple analytic model. The CS (2-1) emission reveals tentative evidence of a slowly moving rotating outflow, which we suggest is entrained not only poloidally but also toroidally by a disk wind that is launched from relatively large radii from the source.},

	Abstract = {We present high sensitivity and high angular resolution images of the high velocity (vLSR>30 km s-1) CO emission in the J=1->0 and J=2->1 lines of the Orion KL region. These results reveal the morphology of the high-velocity CO emission at the most extreme velocities. High velocity emission has only been detected in two regions: BN/KL (IRc2/I) and Orion-S. The Orion-S region contains a very young (dynamical age of ~ 103 years), very fast ( ~ 110 km s-1) and very compact (<~0.16 pc) bipolar outflow. From the morphology of the high-velocity gas we estimate that the position of the powering source must be 20'' north of FIR 4. So far, the exciting source of this outflow has not been detected. For the IRc2/I molecular outflow the morphology of the moderate velocity (<~60 km s-1) gas shows a weak bipolarity around IRc2/I. The gas at the most extreme velocities does not show any bipolarity around IRc2/I, if any, it is found ~ 30'' north from these sources. The blue and redshifted gas at moderate velocities shows similar spatial distribution with a systematic trend for the size of the high-velocity gas to decrease as the terminal radial velocity increases. The same trend is also found for the jet driven molecular outflows L 1448 and IRAS 03282+3035. The size-velocity relationship is fitted with a simple velocity law which considers a highly collimated jet and entrained material outside the jet moving in the radial direction. We also find that most of the CO outflowing at moderate velocities is located at the head of the jet. Our results and the spatial distribution and kinematics of the shock tracers in this outflow can be explained if the IRc2/I outflow is driven by a precessing jet oriented along the line of sight. The implication of these findings in the evolution of molecular outflows is discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present high angular resolution (12"-24") and high-sensitivity 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 observations of the HH 1-2 outflow. The observations show the molecular counterpart, moving with a velocity of ~=30 km s-1, of the optical bipolar system driven by the VLA 1 embedded source. Along with the optical jet there are certain regions where the molecular gas reaches deprojected velocities of 100-200 km s-1 and that we interpret as the molecular jet. The bipolar CO outflow has a length of ~260" with a curved morphology toward the north where it extends beyond the HH 1 object (~=120"). Two new molecular outflows have been detected, one arising from IRAS 05339-0647, which excites the HH 147 optical flow, and another powered by VLA 2, which drives the HH 144 optical outflow. The molecular outflow driven by the VLA 3 source is also clearly detected and spatially resolved from the VLA 1 main outflow.},

	Abstract = {Outflows from accreting, rotating, and magnetized systems are ubiquitous. Protostellar outflows can be observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths in the continuum and a multitude of spectral lines that probe a wide range of physical conditions, chemical phases, radial velocities, and proper motions. Wide-field visual and near-IR data, mid-IR observations from space, and aperture synthesis with centimeter- and millimeterwave interferometers are revolutionizing outflow studies. Many outflows originate in multiple systems and clusters. Although most flows are bipolar and some contain highly collimated jets, others are wide-angle winds, and a few are nearly isotropic and exhibit explosive behavior. Morphologies and velocity fields indicate variations in ejection velocity, mass-loss rate, and in some cases, flow orientation and degree of collimation. These trends indicate that stellar accretion is episodic and often occurs in a complex dynamical environment. Outflow power increases with source luminosity but decreases with evolutionary stage. The youngest outflows are small and best traced by molecules such as CO, SiO, H2O, and H2. Older outflows can grow to parsec scales and are best traced by shock-excited atoms and ions such as hydrogen-recombination lines, [Sii], and [Oii]. Outflows inject momentum and energy into their surroundings and provide an important mechanism in the self-regulation of star formation. However, momentum injection rates remain uncertain with estimates providing lower bounds.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a 2300 arcmin2 survey of the Orion A molecular cloud at 450 and 850 mum using the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The region mapped lies directly south of the OMC 1 cloud core and includes OMC 4, OMC 5, HH 1/2, HH 34, and L1641N. We identify 71 independent clumps in the 850 mum map and compute size, flux, and degree of central concentration in each. Comparison with isothermal, pressure-confined, self-gravitating Bonnor-Ebert spheres implies that the clumps have internal temperatures Td~22+/-5 K and surface pressures log(k-1 P cm-3 K)=6.0+/-0.2. The clump masses span the range 0.3-22 Msolar assuming a dust temperature Td~20 K and a dust emissivity kappa850=0.02 cm2 g-1. The distribution of clump masses is well characterized by a power law N(M)~M-alpha with alpha=2.0+/-0.5 for M>3.0 Msolar, indicating a clump mass function steeper than the stellar initial mass function. Significant incompleteness makes determination of the slope at lower masses difficult. A comparison of the submillimeter emission map with an H2 2.122 mum survey of the same region is performed. Several new Class 0 sources are revealed and a correlation is found between both the column density and degree of concentration of the submillimeter sources and the likelihood of coincident H2 shock emission.},

	Abstract = {Forty new low-mass members with spectral types ranging from M4 to M9 have been confirmed in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 region. Through deep, I-, z'-, J-, H-, and K-band photometry of a 20' × 20' field in OMC 2/3, we selected brown dwarf candidates for follow-up spectroscopy. Low-resolution far-red and near-infrared spectra were obtained for the candidates, and 19 young brown dwarfs in the OMC 2/3 region are confirmed. They exhibit spectral types of M6.5-M9, corresponding to approximate masses of 0.075-0.015 M&sun; using the evolutionary models of Baraffe et al. At least one of these bona fide young brown dwarfs has strong Halpha emission, indicating that it is actively accreting. In addition, we confirm 21 new low-mass members with spectral types of M4-M6, corresponding to approximate masses of 0.35-0.10 M&sun; in OMC 2/3. By comparing pre-main-sequence tracks to the positions of the members in the H-R diagram, we find that most of the brown dwarfs are less than 1 Myr, but find a number of low-mass stars with inferred ages greater than 3 Myr. The discrepancy in the stellar and substellar ages is due to our selection of only low-luminosity sources; however, the presence of such objects implies the presence of an age spread in the OMC 2/3 region. We discuss possible reasons for this apparent age spread.  Some of the observations presented here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, Whipple Observatory, W. M. Keck Observatory, Las Campanas Observatory, Mount Graham International Observatory, and Apache Point Observatory. The MMT Observatory is a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona. The W. M. Keck Observatory is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The W. M. Keck Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

	Abstract = {The visually familiar Trapezium cluster is but one of three centers of recent star formation in the Orion Nebula, with the other two still embedded in its host molecular cloud. The Orion Nebula was produced when the hottest stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster photoionized local gaseous material, forming an open cavity around the Trapezium stars, with a background blister of ionized gas, then a photon dominated region beyond that. On the near side there is a neutral veil of material. The cluster members include many proplyds, young stellar objects that are rendered more visible by being in or near an H II region. Their existence is an argument that the most massive stars in the cluster formed only recently. The second-most luminous star formation center is in the BN-KL region and is embedded in the molecular cloud, which means that it is seen only in X-ray, infrared, and radio wavelengths. There are arguments that it experienced a major energetic event 500--1000 years ago, producing runaway objects and a host of expanding fingers of gas and dust. The third center of star formation, Orion-S,  lies only slightly behind the photon dominated region and produces multiple outflows, most of which are bipolar, and are seen in molecular and ionized atomic emission. The proximity of the Orion Nebula and its conditions of low extinction mean that it is the richest region of coll ejecta from pre-main sequence low-mass stars.},

	Abstract = {A large-scale, high-resolution map of CO (1-0) emission toward the OMC-2 and OMC-3 star-forming regions is presented. The map is a mosaic of 46 fields using the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA) and covers ~10'×15' at ~10" resolution. These data are combined with single-dish FCRAO observations and analyzed to identify and determine the properties of nine protostellar outflows. The BIMA data alone almost completely resolve out the cloud emission at central velocities and only recover 1/20 of the flux in the high-velocity gas, showing that outflows are generally broadly dispersed over ~1' angular scales. All nine identified outflows emanate from known Class 0 or borderline Class 0/I sources, are associated with knots of shocked H2 emission, and have short dynamical times. It is suggested that only the youngest, most spatially compact, and energetic outflows have been found and that more distributed high-velocity gas undetected by BIMA is due to older outflows continuing through the Class I phase of protostellar evolution. The mechanical energy injection rate into the cloud is estimated to be ~1.5 Lsolar, which is comparable to the turbulent energy dissipation rate. Outflows appear capable, therefore, of sustaining cloud turbulence but a high star formation rate is required, implying a short cloud lifetime of <=5 Myr.},

	Abstract = {Aims: A census of molecular hydrogen flows across the entire Orion A giant molecular cloud is sought. With this paper we aim to associate each flow with its progenitor and associated molecular core, so that the characteristics of the outflows and outflow sources can be established. Methods: We present wide-field near-infrared images of Orion A, obtained with the Wide Field Camera, WFCAM, on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. Broad-band K and narrow-band H2 1-0S(1) images of a contiguous ~8 square degree region are compared to mid-IR photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope and (sub)millimetre dust-continuum maps obtained with the MAMBO and SCUBA bolometer arrays. Using previously-published H2 images, we also measured proper motions for H2 features in 33 outflows, and use these data to help associate flows with existing sources and/or dust cores.  Results: Together these data give a detailed picture of dynamical star formation across this extensive region. We increase the number of known H2 outflows to 116. A total of 111 H2 flows were observed with Spitzer; outflow sources are identified for 72 of them (12 more H2 flows have tentative progenitors). The MAMBO 1200 mum maps cover 97 H2 flows; 57 of them (59%) are associated with Spitzer sources and either dust cores or extended 1200 mum emission. The H2 jets are widely distributed and randomly orientated. The jets do not appear to be orthogonal to large-scale filaments or even to the small-scale cores associated with the outflow sources (at least when traced with the 11´´ resolution of the 1200 mum MAMBO observations). Moreover, H2 jet lengths (L) and opening angles (theta) are not obviously correlated with indicators of outflow source age - source spectral index, alpha (measured from mid-IR photometry), or (sub)millimetre core flux. It seems clear that excitation requirements limit the usefulness of H2 as a tracer of L and theta (though jet position angles are well defined).  Conclusions: We demonstrate that H2 jet sources are predominantly protostellar sources with flat or positive mid-IR spectral indices, rather than disc-excess (or T Tauri) stars. Most protostars associated with molecular cores drive H2 outflows; however, not all molecular cores are associated with protostars or H2 jets. On statistical grounds, the H2 jet phase may be marginally shorter than the protostellar phase, though it must be considerably (by an order of magnitude) shorter than the prestellar phase. In terms of range and mean value of alpha, H2 jet sources are indistinguishable from protostars. The spread in alpha observed for both protostars and H2 outflow sources is probably a function of inclination angle as much as source age. The few true protostars without H2 jets are almost certainly more evolved than their H2-jet-driving counterparts, although these later stages of protostellar evolution (as the source transitions to being a ``disc-excess'' source) must be very brief, since a large fraction of protostars do drive H2 flows. We also find that the protostars that power molecular outflows are no more (nor no less) clustered than protostars that do not. This suggests that the H2 emission regions in jets and outflows from young stars weaken and fade very quickly, before the source evolves from protostar to pre-main-sequence star, and on time-scales much shorter than those associated with the T Tauri phase, the Herbig-Haro jet phase, and the dispersal of young stellar objects.

	Abstract = {We performed the first spectral line survey at 82-106 GHz and 335-355 GHz toward the outflow-shocked region OMC 2-FIR 4, the outflow driving source FIR 3, and the northern outflow lobe FIR 3N. We detected 120 lines of 20 molecular species. The line profiles can be classified into two types: one type is a single Gaussian component with a narrow (<3 km s-1) width, and the other type is two Gaussian components with narrow and wide (>3 km s-1) widths. The narrow components for most of the lines are detected at all positions, suggesting that they trace the ambient dense gas. For CO, CS, HCN, and HCO+, the wide components are detected at all positions, suggesting an outflow origin. The wide components of C34S, SO, SiO, H13CN, HC15N, {{{H}}}213CO, H2CS, HC3N, and CH3OH are only detected at FIR 4, suggesting an origin as outflow-shocked gas. The rotation diagram analysis revealed that the narrow components of C2H and H13CO+ show low temperatures of 12.5 $\pm$ 1.4 K, while the wide components show high temperatures of 20-70 K. This supports our interpretation that the wide components trace the outflow and/or outflow-shocked gas. We compared the observed molecular abundances relative to H13CO+ with those of the outflow-shocked region L 1157 B1 and the hot corino IRAS 16293-2422. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the chemical enrichment in FIR 4 is caused by hot-core chemistry, the chemical compositions in FIR 4 are more similar to those in L 1157 B1 than those in IRAS 16293-2422.},

	Abstract = {Using the ASTE 10 m submillimeter telescope and the 1.4 m Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF), we performed an extensive outflow survey in the Orion Molecular Cloud 2 and 3 region. Our survey, which includes 41 potential star-forming sites, has been newly compiled using multiwavelength data based on millimeter- and submillimeter-continuum observations, as well as radio continuum observations. From the CO(3-2) observations performed with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10 m telescope, we detected 14 CO molecular outflows, seven of which were newly identified. This higher detection rate, as compared to previous CO(1-0) results in the same region, suggests that CO(3-2) may be a better outflow tracer. Physical properties of these outflows and their possible driving sources were derived. Derived parameters were compared with those of CO outflows in low- and high-mass star-forming regions. We show that the CO outflow momentum correlates with the bolometric luminosity of the driving source and with the envelope mass, regardless of the mass of the driving sources. In addition to these CO outflows, seven sources having near-IR features suggestive of outflows were also identified.},

@article{ODell15,
	Abstract = {Recent Hubble Space Telescope images have allowed the determination with unprecedented accuracy of motions and changes of shocks within the inner Orion Nebula. These originate from collimated outflows from very young stars, some within the ionized portion of the nebula and others within the host molecular cloud. We have doubled the number of Herbig-Haro objects known within the inner Orion Nebula. We find that the best-known Herbig-Haro shocks originate from relatively few stars, with the optically visible X-ray source COUP 666 driving many of them. While some isolated shocks are driven by single collimated outflows, many groups of shocks are the result of a single stellar source having jets oriented in multiple directions at similar times. This explains the feature that shocks aligned in opposite directions in the plane of the sky are usually blueshifted because the redshifted outflows pass into the optically thick photon-dominated region behind the nebula. There are two regions from which optical outflows originate for which there are no candidate sources in the SIMBAD database.

@article{Bally17,
	Abstract = {Most massive stars form in dense clusters where gravitational interactions with other stars may be common. The two nearest forming massive stars, the BN object and Source I, located behind the Orion Nebula, were ejected with velocities of ˜29 and ˜13 km s-1 about 500 years ago by such interactions. This event generated an explosion in the gas. New ALMA observations show in unprecedented detail, a roughly spherically symmetric distribution of over a hundred 12CO J = 2-1 streamers with velocities extending from V LSR = -150 to +145 km s-1. The streamer radial velocities increase (or decrease) linearly with projected distance from the explosion center, forming a ``Hubble Flow'' confined to within 50" of the explosion center. They point toward the high proper-motion, shock-excited H2 and [Fe ii] ``fingertips'' and lower-velocity CO in the H2 wakes comprising Orion's ``fingers.'' In some directions, the H2 ``fingers'' extend more than a factor of two farther from the ejection center than the CO streamers. Such deviations from spherical symmetry may be caused by ejecta running into dense gas or the dynamics of the N-body interaction that ejected the stars and produced the explosion. This ˜1048 erg event may have been powered by the release of gravitational potential energy associated with the formation of a compact binary or a protostellar merger. Orion may be the prototype for a new class of stellar explosiozn responsible for luminous infrared transients in nearby galaxies.},

We combine these spectra and metallicities with (1) rest-frame UV-to-optical imaging, which allows us to determine stellar masses and dust attenuation corrections, and (2) Halpha narrowband imaging, which provides a robust measurement of the instantaneous SFR. Our sample spans stellar masses of ˜109-6 × 1011 {{M}&sun; }, SFRs of 0.4-270 {{M}&sun; } yr-1, and metal abundances of 12+log (O/H)≈ 8.3-9.1 (≈ 0.4-2.6 {{Z}&sun; }). The correlations that we find between the Halpha-based SFR and stellar mass (i.e., the star-forming ``main sequence'') and between the stellar mass and metallicity are both consistent with previous z˜ 1 studies of star-forming galaxies. We then study the relationship between the three properties using various plane-fitting techniques and a curve-fitting projection. In all cases, we exclude strong dependence of the {{M}\star }-Z relation on SFR, but are unable to distinguish between moderate and no dependence. Our results are consistent with previous mass-metallicity-SFR studies. We check whether data set limitations may obscure a strong dependence on the SFR by using mock samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These experiments reveal that the adopted signal-to-noise ratio cuts may have a significant effect on the measured dependence. Further work is needed to investigate these results, and to test whether a ``fundamental metallicity relation'' or a ``fundamental plane'' describes star-forming galaxies across cosmic time.},

	Abstract = {We present a survey of 28 molecular outflows driven by low-mass protostars, all of which are sufficiently isolated spatially and/or kinematically to fully separate into individual outflows. Using a combination of new and archival data from several single-dish telescopes, 17 outflows are mapped in 12CO (2-1) and 17 are mapped in 12CO (3-2), with 6 mapped in both transitions. For each outflow, we calculate and tabulate the mass (M flow), momentum (P flow), kinetic energy (E flow), mechanical luminosity (L flow), and force (F flow) assuming optically thin emission in LTE at an excitation temperature, T ex, of 50 K. We show that all of the calculated properties are underestimated when calculated under these assumptions. Taken together, the effects of opacity, outflow emission at low velocities confused with ambient cloud emission, and emission below the sensitivities of the observations increase outflow masses and dynamical properties by an order of magnitude, on average, and factors of 50-90 in the most extreme cases. Different (and non-uniform) excitation temperatures, inclination effects, and dissociation of molecular gas will all work to further increase outflow properties. Molecular outflows are thus almost certainly more massive and energetic than commonly reported. Additionally, outflow properties are lower, on average, by almost an order of magnitude when calculated from the 12CO (3-2) maps compared to the 12CO (2-1) maps, even after accounting for different opacities, map sensitivities, and possible excitation temperature variations. It has recently been argued in the literature that the 12CO (3-2) line is subthermally excited in outflows, and our results support this finding.},

	Abstract = {While observational evidence for the episodic nature of young stellar outflows continues to mount, existing numerical and theoretical models of molecular outflows assume that they are formed by the interaction of a nonepisodic wind from a young stellar object with an ambient cloud. In this Letter, we estimate and discuss the effects of episodicity on the mass-velocity and position-velocity relations observed in molecular outflows. We explain how many recent observational results disagree with the predictions of nonepisodic outflow models, and we offer simple explanations for the discrepancies. In particular, we discuss how an episodic stellar outflow can steepen the power-law slope of the mass-velocity relation in a molecular outflow. And we illustrate how an episodic outflow can produce multiple ``Hubble wedges'' in the position-velocity distribution of a molecular outflow. With a little more information than we have now, it may be possible to use the ``fossil record'' embedded in a molecular outflow's mass-velocity and position-velocity relations to reconstruct the history of a young stellar object's mass ejection episodes.},

	Abstract = {We present the first set of detailed molecular-line maps of the region associated with the giant Herbig-Haro flow HH 300 from the young star IRAS 04239+2436. Our results indicate that the red lobe of the HH 300 flow is depositing a fair amount of momentum [3.2(sini)-1 Msolar km s-1] and kinetic energy [2.6(sini)-2×1043 ergs] over a notable volume (~11%) of its host dark cloud. This makes HH 300 a key player in the evolution and fate of its parent cloud. The redshifted molecular outflow lobe of HH 300 is 1.1 pc long and 0.3 pc wide and has a very clumpy structure. The density, velocity, and momentum distributions in the outflow indicate that the observed clumps arise from the prompt entrainment of ambient gas. Bow shock-shaped structures are associated with the clumps, and we hypothesize that the shocks are produced by different mass ejection episodes. Lines drawn from IRAS 04239+2436 to each of these clumps have different orientations on the plane of the sky, and we conclude that HH 300 is a precessing and episodic outflow. The observations include a map of the red lobe in the CO (2-1) line, with a beam size of 27", and more extended maps of the outflow region in the 12CO (1-0) and 13CO (1-0) lines, with 45" and 47" beam sizes, respectively. Due to ``contamination'' by emission from another molecular cloud along the same line of sight, we are not able to study the blueshifted lobe of HH 300. The combined 12CO (1-0) and 13CO (1-0) line observations enable us to estimate the outflow mass accounting for the velocity-dependent opacity of the 12CO (1-0) line. This method is much more precise than using 12CO data alone. We obtain a steep power-law mass spectrum for HH 300, which we believe is best explained by the evolution of the outflow mass kinematics. In addition, our 13CO (1-0) observations show that the HH 300 flow has been able to redistribute (in space and velocity) considerable amounts of its surrounding medium-density (~103 cm-3) gas.},

	Abstract = {Spectral datasets obtained at radio frequencies and optical/IR wavelengths are increasing in complexity as new facilities and instruments come online,  resulting in an increased need to visualize and quantitatively analyze  the velocity structures. As the visible structure in spectral data  cubes is not purely spatial, additional insight is required to relate  structures in 2D space plus line-of-sight velocity to their true three-dimensional (3D) structures.  This can be achieved through the  use of models that are converted to velocity-space representations.  We have used the S2PLOT programming library to enable intuitive,  interactive comparison between 3D models  and spectral data, with  potential for improved understanding of the spatial configurations.  We also report on the use of 3D Cartesian shapelets to support quantitative analysis.},

	Abstract = {We present an investigation of the statistical properties of fluctuating gas motions in five nearby molecular clouds using the two-point autocorrelation and structure functions and the power spectra of their radial velocity structure as traced by emission-line centroid velocities. Our analysis includes observations made with the AT&T Bell Laboratories 7 m Crawford Hill antenna (1'.7 beamwidth) of (13)CO J = 1 right arrow 0 emission in Orion B, Mon R2, L1228, and L1551 and also (13)CO J = 2 right arrow 1 observations of the molecular gas surrounding the Herbig-Haro object HH 83 lying just west of L1641 in the Orion A cloud that were obtained with a higher spatial resolution (0 min .22) using the IRAM-30 m telescope on Pico Veleta, Spain. The effects of beam smoothing and the interpolation of a set of observations onto a regular spatial grid are studied using model spectral line data cubes, and we find that the behavior of the statistical functions presented here and those presented elsewhere by other authors are heavily influenced by these effects at scales comparable to and somewhat larger than the beamwidth. At larger lags real correlations are detected, and we use the e-folding length of the autocorrelation function (i.e., the correlation length) to investigate the characteristic scales of the underlying turbulent flow. We find that this measure is dependent on the range of scales sampled by the observations themselves both for our data and for previously existing observations presented by other authors, and we interpret this result and the observed similarity between the functional forms of the statistical functions derived for different data sets as evidence for a self-similar turbulent hierarchy of gas motions extending over a wide range of scales in the interstellar medium. Power-law fits to the observed structure functions yield a mean index describing the hierarchy of 0.86 +/- 0.3, which translates into a velocity dispersion-region size relationship of the type first introduced by Larson (1981), Delta V varies as lgamma, with gamma = 0.43 +/- 0.15. This result is consistent with that found by Larson in his original analysis, gamma approximately equals 0.38, and with the range found in more recent studies, 0.35 less than gamma less than 0.7. We also discuss the observed scaling laws in relation to the predictions of phenomenological theories of forced, isotropic turbulence. The mean turbulent stress and maximum energy transport rate as a function of scale are obtained from the velocity power spectra following the procedure of Kleiner & Dickman, and the results are discussed in the context of scale-dependent star formation and the generation of turbulence in molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {We have modeled H I shells expanding into a homogeneous medium in order to explain some of their observational peculiarities. Such peculiarities include difficult-to-observe caps, the presence of stationary rings, expansion velocity determination problems, inaccurate mass measurements, and a systematic discrepancy between H I missing masses and shell masses. Velocity dispersion within the shell, in the form of either thermal or turbulent motions, has been found to be the likely major cause for the absence of observable caps and the presence of stationary rings, hence explaining the apparent lack of ring transition. We discuss different methods generally used to calculate H I shell masses and show that, if one does not take into account the varying shape of the H I background local to the shell, shell masses are likely to be underestimated by a significant factor whose value depends on the relative shell thickness and the ratio of the dispersion to the expansion velocity.},

	Abstract = {The Orion-Eridanus superbubble is the prototypical superbubble owing to its proximity and evolutionary state. Here we provide a synthesis of recent observational data from WISE and Planck with archival data, allowing us to draw a new and more complete picture on the history and evolution of the Orion-Eridanus region. We discuss the general morphological structures and observational characteristics of the superbubble and derive quantitative properties of the gas and dust inside Barnard's Loop. We reveal that Barnard's Loop is a complete bubble structure that, together with the lambda Ori region and other smaller-scale bubbles, expands within the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. We argue that the Orion-Eridanus superbubble is larger and more complex than previously thought, and that it can be viewed as a series of nested shells, superimposed along the line of sight. During the lifetime of the superbubble, Hii region champagne flows and thermal evaporation of embedded clouds continuously mass-load the superbubble interior, while winds or supernovae from the Orion OB association rejuvenate the superbubble by sweeping up the material from the interior cavities in an episodic fashion, possibly triggering the formation of new stars that form shells of their own. The steady supply of material into the superbubble cavity implies that dust processing from interior supernova remnants is more efficient than previously thought. The cycle of mass loading, interior cleansing, and star formation repeats until the molecular reservoir is depleted or the clouds have been disrupted. While the nested shells come and go, the superbubble remains for tens of millions of years.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the shells (and bubbles) in the Perseus molecular cloud using the COMPLETE survey large-scale 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) maps. The 12 shells reported here are spread throughout most of the Perseus cloud and have circular or arc-like morphologies with a range in radius of about 0.1-3 pc. Most of them have not been detected before most likely because maps of the region lacked the coverage and resolution needed to distinguish them. The majority of the shells are coincident with infrared nebulosity of similar shape and have a candidate powering source near the center. We suggest that they are formed by the interaction of spherical or very wide angle winds powered by young stars inside or near the Perseus molecular cloud---a cloud that is commonly considered to be forming mostly low-mass stars. Two of the 12 shells are powered by high-mass stars close to the cloud, while the others appear to be powered by low- or intermediate-mass stars in the cloud. We argue that winds with a mass loss rate of about 10-8 to 10-6 M &sun; yr-1 are required to produce the observed shells. Our estimates indicate that the energy input rate from these stellar winds is similar to the turbulence dissipation rate. We conclude that in Perseus the total energy input from both collimated protostellar outflows and powerful spherical winds from young stars is sufficient to maintain the turbulence in the molecular cloud. Large-scale molecular line and IR continuum maps of a sample of clouds will help determine the frequency of this phenomenon in other star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {Using the IRAM 30 m telescope, we have surveyed a 1 × 0.$\,^{\circ}$8 part of the Orion molecular cloud in the 12CO and 13CO (2-1) lines with a maximal spatial resolution of ~11'' and spectral resolution of ~0.4 km s-1. The cloud appears filamentary, clumpy, and with a complex kinematical structure. We derive an estimated mass of the cloud of 7700 M &sun; (half of which is found in regions with visual extinctions AV below ~10) and a dynamical age for the nebula of the order of 0.2 Myr. The energy balance suggests that magnetic fields play an important role in supporting the cloud, at large and small scales. According to our analysis, the turbulent kinetic energy in the molecular gas due to outflows is comparable to turbulent kinetic energy resulting from the interaction of the cloud with the H II region. This latter feedback appears negative, i.e., the triggering of star formation by the H II region is inefficient in Orion. The reduced data as well as additional products such as the column density map are made available online (http://userpages.irap.omp.eu/~oberne/Olivier_Berne/Data).},

@article{Lucas17,
	Abstract = {We investigate how star formation efficiency can be significantly decreased by the removal of a molecular cloud's envelope by feedback from an external source. Feedback from star formation has difficulties halting the process in dense gas but can easily remove the less dense and warmer envelopes where star formation does not occur. However, the envelopes can play an important role keeping their host clouds bound by deepening the gravitational potential and providing a constraining pressure boundary. We use numerical simulations to show that removal of the cloud envelopes results in all cases in a fall in the star formation efficiency (SFE). At 1.38 free-fall times our 4 pc cloud simulation experienced a drop in the SFE from 16 to six percent, while our 5 pc cloud fell from 27 to 16 per cent. At the same time, our 3 pc cloud (the least bound) fell from an SFE of 5.67 per cent to zero when the envelope was lost. The star formation efficiency per free-fall time varied from zero to ≈0.25 according to alpha, defined to be the ratio of the kinetic plus thermal to gravitational energy, and irrespective of the absolute star forming mass available. Furthermore the fall in SFE associated with the loss of the envelope is found to even occur at later times. We conclude that the SFE will always fall should a star forming cloud lose its envelope due to stellar feedback, with less bound clouds suffering the greatest decrease.},

	Abstract = {We study the fragmentation of the nearest high line-mass filament, the integral shaped filament (ISF, line-mass $\sim$ 400 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-1}$) in the Orion A molecular cloud. We have observed a 1.6 pc long section of the ISF with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 3 mm continuum emission, at a resolution of $\sim$3" (1 200 AU). We identify from the region 43 dense cores with masses about a solar mass. 60% of the ALMA cores are protostellar and 40\% are starless. The nearest neighbour separations of the cores do not show a preferred fragmentation scale; the frequency of short separations increases down to 1 200 AU. We apply a two-point correlation analysis on the dense core separations and show that the ALMA cores are significantly grouped at separations below $\sim$17 000 AU and strongly grouped below $\sim$6 000 AU. The protostellar and starless cores are grouped differently: only the starless cores group strongly below $\sim$6 000 AU. In addition, the spatial distribution of the cores indicates periodic grouping of the cores into groups of $\sim$30 000 AU in size, separated by $\sim$50 000 AU. The groups coincide with dust column density peaks detected by Herschel. These results show hierarchical, two-mode fragmentation in which the maternal filament periodically fragments into groups of dense cores. Critically, our results indicate that the fragmentation models for lower line-mass filaments ($\sim$ 16 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-1}$) fail to capture the observed properties of the ISF. We also find that the protostars identified with Spitzer and Herschel in the ISF are grouped at separations below $\sim$17 000 AU. In contrast, young stars with disks do not show significant grouping. This suggests that the grouping of dense cores is partially retained over the protostar lifetime, but not over the lifetime of stars with disks.},

@article{Orkisz17,
	Abstract = {The nature of turbulence in molecular clouds is one of the key parameters that control star formation efficiency: compressive motions, as opposed to solenoidal motions, can trigger the collapse of cores, or mark the expansion of Hii regions. We try to observationally derive the fractions of momentum density ($\rho v$) contained in the solenoidal and compressive modes of turbulence in the Orion B molecular cloud and relate these fractions to the star formation efficiency in the cloud. The implementation of a statistical method developed by Brunt & Federrath (2014), applied to a $^{13}$CO(J=1-0) datacube obtained with the IRAM-30m telescope, allows us to retrieve 3-dimensional quantities from the projected quantities provided by the observations, yielding an estimate of the compressive versus solenoidal ratio in various regions of the cloud. Despite the Orion B molecular cloud being highly supersonic (mean Mach number $\sim$ 6), the fractions of motion in each mode diverge significantly from equipartition. The cloud's motions are on average mostly solenoidal (excess > 8 % with respect to equipartition), which is consistent with its low star formation rate. On the other hand, the motions around the main star-forming regions (NGC 2023 and NGC 2024) prove to be strongly compressive. We have successfully applied to observational data a method that was so far only tested on simulations, and have shown that there can be a strong intra-cloud variability of the compressive and solenoidal fractions, these fractions being in turn related to the star formation efficiency. This opens a new possibility for star-formation diagnostics in galactic molecular clouds.},

@article{Hartmann02,
	Abstract = {The remarkably filamentary spatial distribution of young stars in the Taurus molecular cloud has significant implications for understanding low-mass star formation in relatively quiescent conditions. The large scale and regular spacing of the filaments suggests that small-scale turbulence is of limited importance, which could be consistent with the driving on large scales by flows that produced the cloud. The small spatial dispersion of stars from gaseous filaments indicates that the low-mass stars are generally born with small velocity dispersions relative to their natal gas, of the order of the sound speed or less. The spatial distribution of the stars exhibits a mean separation of about 0.25 pc, comparable to the estimated Jeans length in the densest gaseous filaments, and is consistent with roughly uniform density along the filaments. The efficiency of star formation in filaments is much higher than elsewhere, with an associated higher frequency of protostars and accreting T Tauri stars. The protostellar cores are generally aligned with the filaments, suggesting that they are produced by gravitational fragmentation, resulting in initially quasi-prolate cores. Given the absence of massive stars that could strongly dominate cloud dynamics, Taurus provides important tests of theories of dispersed low-mass star formation and numerical simulations of molecular cloud structure and evolution.},

	Abstract = {With the recent recognition of a second, distinctive class of molecular outflows, namely the explosive ones not directly connected to the accretion-ejection process in the star formation, a juxtaposition of the morphological and kinematic properties of both classes is warranted. By applying the same method used in Zapata et al. (2009), and using $^{12}$CO(J=2-1) archival data from the Submillimeter Array (SMA), we contrast two well known explosive objects, Orion KL and DR21, to HH211 and DG Tau B, two flows representative of classical low-mass protostellar outflows. At the moment there are only two well established cases of explosive outflows, but with the full availability of ALMA we expect that more examples will be found in the near future. Main results are the largely different spatial distributions of the explosive flows, consisting of numerous narrow straight filament-like ejections with different orientations and in almost an isotropic configuration, the red with respect to the blueshifted components of the flows (maximally separated in protostellar, largely overlapping in explosive outflows), the very well-defined Hubble flow-like increase of velocity with distance from the origin in the explosive filaments versus the mostly non-organized CO velocity field in protostellar objects, and huge inequalities in mass, momentum and energy of the two classes, at least for the case of low-mass flows. Finally, all the molecular filaments in the explosive outflows point back to approximately a central position i.e. the place where its "exciting source" was located, contrary to the bulk of the molecular material within the protostellar outflows.},

	Abstract = {We present subarcsecond images of submillimeter CO and continuum emission from a local galaxy forming massive star clusters: the blue compact dwarf galaxy II Zw 40. At $\sim$0.4" resolution (20 pc), the CO(3-2), CO(1-0), 3mm and 870${\mu}$m continuum maps illustrate star formation on the scales of individual molecular clouds. Dust contributes about a third of the 870${\mu}$m continuum emission, with free-free accounting for the rest. On these scales, there is not a good correspondence between gas, dust, and free-free emission. Dust continuum is enhanced toward the star-forming region as compared to the CO emission. We suggest that an unexpectedly low and spatially variable gas-to-dust ratio is the result of massive clusters of the starburst.},

@article{Castor75,
	Abstract = {The large number of subordinate lines of a representative ion are found to have a dominant effect on the force of radiation on material in O star atmospheres. The force is increased over that due to resonance lines alone so that rates of mass loss are obtained which are 100 times greater than previously thought possible. The force is related to the solution of the line-transfer problem, and it becomes a function of the local velocity gradient. A new stellar wind theory, with a different interpretation of the singular point, is developed to treat this situation. The rate of mass loss, and other properties of the model, are uniquely specified by the luminosity, mass, and radius of the star. Alternative static models do not exist. Numerical results give a rate of mass loss equal to .000006 solar mass per year for an O5 star, with a terminal velocity of 1500 km/sec. The rate of mass loss is sensitive to stellar parameters, while the terminal velocity is not.},

@article{Arce06,
	Abstract = {We present multiline and continuum observations of the circumstellar environment within 104 AU of a sample of protostars to investigate how the effects of outflows on their immediate environment change over time. 12CO (1-0) emission probes the high-velocity molecular outflows near the protostars and demonstrates that the outflow opening angle widens as the nascent star evolves. Maps of the 13CO (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) outflow emission show that protostellar winds erode the circumstellar envelope through the entrainment of the outer envelope gas. The spatial and velocity distribution of the dense circumstellar envelope, as well as its mass, is traced by the C18O (1-0) emission and also displays evolutionary changes. We show that outflows are largely responsible for these changes and propose an empirical model for the evolution of outflow-envelope interactions. In addition, some of the outflows in our sample appear to affect the chemical composition of the surrounding environment, enhancing the HCO+ abundance. Overall, our results confirm that outflows play a major role in the star formation process through their strong physical and chemical impacts on the environments of the young protostars.},

	Abstract = {We identify 709 arc-shaped mid-infrared nebula in 24 micron Spitzer Space Telescope or 22 micron Wide Field Infrared Explorer surveys of the Galactic Plane as probable dusty interstellar bowshocks powered by early-type stars. About 20% are visible at 8 microns or shorter mid-infrared wavelengths as well. The vast majority (660) have no previous identification in the literature. These extended infrared sources are strongly concentrated near Galactic mid-Plane with an angular scale height of ~0.6 degrees. All host a symmetrically placed star implicated as the source of a stellar wind sweeping up interstellar material. These are candidate "runaway" stars potentially having high velocities in the reference frame of the local medium. Among the 286 objects with measured proper motions, we find an unambiguous excess having velocity vectors aligned with the infrared morphology --- kinematic evidence that many of these are "runaway" stars with large peculiar motions responsible for the bowshock signature. We discuss a population of "in-situ" bowshocks (103 objects) that face giant HII regions where the relative motions between the star and ISM may be caused by bulk outflows from an overpressured bubble. We also identify 58 objects that face 8 micron bright-rimmed clouds and apparently constitute a sub-class of in-situ bowshocks where the stellar wind interacts with a photo-evaporative flow from an eroding molecular cloud interface (i.e., "PEF bowshocks"). Orientations of the arcuate nebulae exhibit a correlation over small angular scales, indicating that external influences such as HII regions are responsible for producing some bowshock nebulae. However, the vast majority of this sample appear to be isolated (499 objects) from obvious external influences.},

	Abstract = {The protostellar outflows of wide-separation forming binaries frequently appear misaligned. We use magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the alignment of protostellar spin and molecular outflows for forming binary pairs. We show that the protostellar pairs, which form from turbulent fragmentation within a single parent core, have randomly oriented angular momentum. Although the pairs migrate to closer separations, their spins remain partially misaligned. We produce 12CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the simulations and characterize the outflow orientation in the emission maps. The CO-identified outflows exhibit a similar random distribution and are also statistically consistent with the observed distribution of molecular outflows. We conclude that the observed misalignment provides a clear signature of binary formation via turbulent fragmentation. The persistence of misaligned outflows and stellar spins following dynamical evolution may provide a signature of binary origins for more evolved multiple star systems.},

	Abstract = {The identification of expanding H I shells is difficult because of their variable morphology. In this paper we present an automatic detector for H I shells, based on the more stable dynamical characteristics of expanding bubbles with radii <40 pc. The detection is performed in two stages. First, artificial neural networks are trained to recognize the dynamical signature of an expanding bubble in the velocity spectra of 21 cm data. The second stage consists of subsequent validations based on the potential bubble's morphology. The technique is tested on 11 known bubbles, and 10 of them are successfully detected. Conducting a systematic detection on a 48deg×9deg region in the Perseus arm, we obtain 7100 detections with spatial distribution following the stellar distribution of the Galactic disk. The estimated radius and expansion velocity distributions for objects with R<=10 pc agree with the distributions predicted by models of adiabatically expanding bubble populations. The fraction of the Perseus arm volume occupied by the detected objects, which can be interpreted as the small bubbles' contribution to the Galactic porosity Q, is calculated to QR<40pc=0.007+0.025-0.003. Four new bubble cases and eight serious candidates, related to known progenitors, are proposed.},

	Abstract = {In the list of young stellar objects compiled by Megeath et al. (2012) for the Orion A molecular cloud, only 44 out of 1208 sources found projected onto low extinction (Ak<0.8 mag) gas are identified as protostars. These objects are puzzling because protostars are not typically expected to be associated with extended low extinction material. Here, we use high resolution extinction maps generated from Herschel data, optical/infrared and Spitzer Space Telescope photometry and spectroscopy of the low extinction protostellar candidate sources to determine if they are likely true protostellar sources or contaminants. Out of 44 candidate objects, we determine that 10 sources are likely protostars, with the rest being more evolved young stellar objects (18), galaxies (4), false detections of nebulosity and cloud edges (9), or real sources for which more data are required to ascertain their nature (3). We find none of the confirmed protostars to be associated with recognizable dense cores and we briefly discuss possible origins for these orphaned objects.},

	Abstract = {Due to its youth, proximity and richness the Orion Nebula Cloud (ONC) is an ideal testbed to obtain a comprehensive view on the Initial Mass Function (IMF) down to the planetary mass regime. Using the HAWK-I camera at the VLT, we have obtained an unprecedented deep and wide near-infrared JHK mosaic of the ONC (90% completeness at K~19.0mag, 22'x28). Applying the most recent isochrones and accounting for the contamination of background stars and galaxies, we find that ONC's IMF is bimodal with distinct peaks at about 0.25 and 0.025 M_sun separated by a pronounced dip at the hydrogen burning limit (0.08 M_sun), with a depth of about a factor 2-3 below the log-normal distribution. Apart from ~920 low-mass stars (M < 1.4 M_sun) the IMF contains ~760 brown dwarf (BD) candidates and ~160 isolated planetary mass object (IPMO) candidates with M > 0.005 M_sun, hence about ten times more substellar candidates than known before. The substellar IMF peak at 0.025 M_sun could be caused by BDs and IPMOs which have been ejected from multiple systems during the early star-formation process or from circumstellar disks.},

	Abstract = {We have identified outflows and bubbles in the Taurus molecular cloud based on the ˜100 deg2 Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) maps and the Spitzer young stellar object catalogs. In the main 44 deg2 area of Taurus, we found 55 outflows, of which 31 were previously unknown. We also found 37 bubbles in the entire 100 deg2 area of Taurus, none of which had been found previously. The total kinetic energy of the identified outflows is estimated to be ˜ 3.9× {10}45 erg, which is 1% of the cloud turbulent energy. The total kinetic energy of the detected bubbles is estimated to be ˜ 9.2× {10}46 erg, which is 29% of the turbulent energy of Taurus. The energy injection rate from the outflows is ˜ 1.3× {10}33 {erg} {{{s}}}-1, which is 0.4-2 times the dissipation rate of the cloud turbulence. The energy injection rate from bubbles is ˜ 6.4× {10}33 erg s-1, which is 2-10 times the turbulent dissipation rate of the cloud. The gravitational binding energy of the cloud is ˜ 1.5× {10}48 erg, that is, 385 and 16 times the energy of outflows and bubbles, respectively. We conclude that neither outflows nor bubbles can provide sufficient energy to balance the overall gravitational binding energy and the turbulent energy of Taurus. However, in the current epoch, stellar feedback is sufficient to maintain the observed turbulence in Taurus.},

An inspection of the kinematics of the Orion A cloud reveals several regions with large-scale expanding motions manifest by nearly circular emission features with radii 10 - 26 arcmin (1.0 - 2.6 pc) and secondary velocity components which are shifted 2 - 3 km/s from the ambient cloud velocity. The presence of these large-scale features, which partially overlap with each other in projection, suggests that the diffuse molecular component of the Orion A cloud as traced by CO emission has been significantly disrupted by events associated with the energetic star forming activity within its domain.},

	Abstract = {It is noted that the Lyman continuum radiation from a cluster of OB stars will drive ionization (I) fronts into nearby neutral material and that an I front should be preceeded by a shock (S) front as it moves into an adjacent molecular cloud near dense nebulae. The gravitational stability of the high-density layer of neutral gas that accumulates between the I and S fronts is investigated to determine whether star formation is likely to occur there. The results show that the shocked neutral layer will become gravitationally unstable after several million years for I-S fronts propagating into molecular clouds of moderate density and that the stars which may form as the layer collapses are likely to be more massive than those which form in unshocked remote parts of the same molecular cloud. It is found that if the stars which eventually form in the shocked layer are OB stars, a new system of I-S fronts will propagate into the remaining cloud after these stars reach the main sequence, and another cycle of OB star formation will be initiated. It is therefore proposed that massive OB stars may be formed in sequential bursts during the lifetime of some large molecular clouds.},

Many new emission-line sources were found, some quite long but so narrow that they are not seen on ground-based images. These include thin shells which are high-ionization shocks. The structure around Orion HH 3 is resolved into multiple components. Slit spectroscopy data establish the high expansion velocities of all these regions. The other objects seen are compact sources. Although some had been detected in VLA surveys and several had been seen from the ground optically, the new images show previously undetected structure and clearly establish that most are protoplanetary disks, which are neutral disks surrounding low-mass pre-main-sequence stars and are ionized from the outside by Theta1 C and Theta2 A Ori.},

	Abstract = {New deep narrowband images of the Orion Nebula obtained with WFPC2 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and spectra taken with the HIRES spectrometer at the Keck Observatory are presented. We report eight new circumstellar disks seen in silhouette against the background nebular light and about 30 dark disks embedded within the bright proplyds rimmed by ionization fronts. Deep narrowband lambda6300 {\AA} images reveal skins of glowing [O I] emission associated with several disks embedded within bright proplyds. [O I] emission also surrounds one dark disk not surrounded by an ionization front; this object may be embedded within the photon-dominated, mostly neutral region behind the ionization front of the Orion Nebula. The intensity and morphology of the [O I] emission provides support for the photon-dominated-region models of externally irradiated circumstellar disks in which soft UV powers photoablation of the disk surface. Dozens of outflows powered by young stars have been discovered on the new images. More than 20 stellar jets emerge from the externally irradiated circumstellar disks or their associated young stars embedded within the Nebula. Most are one-sided (monopolar) subarcsecond-scale microjets, too small to be seen on ground-based images against the bright background nebular light. Additionally, wide-angle winds from 10 young stars in the outskirts of the Nebula power large-scale bow shocks facing the Trapezium OB stars. These shocks may be produced by wind-wind interactions where the T-Tauri winds interact with the outflow of plasma from the core of M42. The largest such structure, associated with the star LL Ori, contains a number of compact high-proper-motion clumps moving almost tangentially to the bow shock. The new data are combined with older HST images to determine proper motions for many nebular features. Neither the LL Ori type bow shocks in the outskirts of the nebula nor the Halpha + [O III] arcs that surround many proplyds near the Trapezium show measurable proper motions and are therefore stationary structures. However, most other bow-shaped features not centered on young stars exhibit large proper motions, with velocities ranging from 50 to 300 km s-1. The sources of many of these moving features remain unknown. The proper-motion survey of the nebular core reveals the presence of about a dozen new large-scale (>0.1 pc) outflow complexes. Many of these new outflows originate from the vicinity of the high-luminosity OMC-1S infrared and submillimeter source complex located southwest of the Trapezium. These supersonic features provide evidence that stellar outflows inject large amounts of kinetic energy into the nebula. However, a quantitative analysis indicates that their total power is small compared with the power in the plasma flowing away from the main nebular ionization front. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

While Bernes 135 is associated with the cometary globule CG 1 in the Gum Nebula, Bernes 136 is associated with the cometary globule CG 13 and is an early F-type field star whose radial velocity relative to the globule is 25.9 km/sec. While the main present source of UV radiation in the Gum Nebula is Zeta Puppis, the evaporation of the globules is not efficient enough to fully destroy any but the smallest modules during the remaining lifetime of Zeta Puppis. A scenario for module formation and evolution is suggested in which UV radiation from a massive O-star can destroy small neighboring clouds and separate less dense cloud material from cloud cores.},

Despite the fact that these two objects partially overlap in PPV space, the two structures can easily be distinguished by eye based on their distinct morphologies. The SVM algorithm is able to infer these morphological distinctions, and associate individual pixels with each object at >90% accuracy. This case study suggests that similar techniques may be applicable to classifying other structures in the ISM---a task that has thus far proven difficult to automate.},

	Abstract = {The winds and radiation from massive stars clear out large cavities in the interstellar medium. These bubbles, as they have been called, impact their surrounding molecular clouds and may influence the formation of stars therein. Here we present James Clerk Maxwell Telescope observations of the J = 3-2 line of CO in 43 bubbles identified with Spitzer Space Telescope observations. These spectroscopic data reveal the three-dimensional structure of the bubbles. In particular, we show that the cold gas lies in a ring, not a sphere, around the bubbles indicating that the parent molecular clouds are flattened with a typical thickness of a few parsecs. We also mapped seven bubbles in the J = 4-3 line of HCO+ and find that the column densities inferred from the CO and HCO+ line intensities are below that necessary for "collect and collapse" models of induced star formation. We hypothesize that the flattened molecular clouds are not greatly compressed by expanding shock fronts, which may hinder the formation of new stars.},

	Abstract = {Quasi-magnetohydrostatic and local ionization equilibria are assumed in the present formulation and solution of the drift of magnetic field and ions embedded in a self-gravitating layer of neutral isothermal gas. The introduction of Lagrangian coordinates referred to the neutral gas allows this problem to be reduced to a nonlinear diffusion equation for the magnetic field, whose dimensionless form involves no parameters other than those introduced by the initial values. In the shape-invariant solution, the magnetic field at each surface density point in the neutral fluid decays as the inverse square root of the elapsed time. Explicit estimates are given, as a function of the initial magnetic to neutral gas pressure in a natural family of cases, for the amount of time that must pass before the shape-invariant solution becomes a good approximation for actual behavior. The results obtained are interpreted physically.},

	Abstract = {This review examines observations of magnetic fields in molecular clouds and what those observations tell us about the theory of molecular cloud evolution and star formation. First, the review briefly summarizes classes of theoretical models of molecular clouds and specific predictions of the models that can be tested by observation. Then, the review describes the techniques for observing and mapping magnetic fields in molecular clouds, followed by discussion of important examples of observational studies using each technique. A synthesis of results from all observational techniques summarizes the current state, which is that though magnetic fields generally dominate turbulence, there is no definitive evidence for magnetic fields dominating gravity in molecular clouds or for ambipolar-diffusion-driven star formation. Finally, the review discusses prospects for advances in our observational capabilities with telescopes and instruments now beginning operation or under construction.},

@article{Andre00,
	Abstract = {The last decade has witnessed significant advances in our observational understanding of the earliest stages of low-mass star formation. The advent of sensitive receivers on large radio telescopes such as the JCMT and IRAM 30m MRT has led to the identification of young protostars at the beginning of the main accretion phase (`Class 0' objects), and has made it possible to probe, for the first time, the inner density structure of pre-collapse cores. Class 0 objects are characterized by strong, centrally-condensed dust continuum emission at submillimeter wavelengths, very little emission shortward of 10 microns, and powerful jet-like outflows. Direct evidence for gravitational infall has been observed toward several of them. They are interpreted as accreting protostars which have not yet accumulated the majority of their final stellar mass. In contrast to protostars, pre-stellar cores have flat inner density profiles, suggesting the initial conditions for fast protostellar collapse depart sometimes significantly from a singular isothermal sphere. In the case of non-singular initial conditions, the beginning of protostellar evolution is expected to feature a brief phase of vigorous accretion/ejection which may coincide with Class 0 objects. In addition, submillimeter continuum imaging surveys of regions of multiple star formation such as Ophiuchus and Serpens suggest a picture according to which each star in an embedded cluster is built from a finite reservoir of mass and the associated IMF is primarily determined at the pre-stellar stage of evolution.},

@article{Thilker98,
	Abstract = {We have developed an automated package of object recognition software to detect and accurately characterize expanding HI supershells in nearby spiral galaxies. Our method avoids the ambiguity associated with visually identifying complex, expanding structures in spectral line datacubes. In this pilot study, an analytic expression for the time evolution of a supershell is used to derive the approximate structure of a parameterized shell expanding inside a plane-stratified gaseous disk. The resulting model is projected spatially and in velocity to determine an ``observable'' signature for the expanding structure. We then cross-correlate an observed HI datacube with an ensemble of these 3-dimensional filter kernels, which specify the predicted appearance of shells having different sizes and expansion velocities. Processed datacubes often contain correlation peaks of statistical significance, regions in which observed emission matches the appearance of a model supershell. To demonstrate our automated package, we describe properties of 50 high quality supershells in NGC 2403, comprising 2.1x10(8) M_&sun; of HI and at least 2.2x10(54) ergs of kinetic energy. We are analyzing 20 other galaxies with our object recognition software, looking for variation in supershell characteristics as a function of Hubble type and star formation rate.},

	Abstract = {We present investigations of the feedback of a luminous Herbig Be star, IL Cep. We mapped the vicinity of IL Cep in the J = 1-0 transitions of 12CO, 13CO and C18O molecular lines with the Purple Mountain Observatory 13.7 m telescope. Archival data from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer were also employed. A parsec-scale cavity that has probably been excavated by the dominant HBe star, IL Cep, is revealed. An expanding shell-like structure featured by 12CO(J = 1-0) emission was found surrounding the cavity, which embeds several 13CO(J = 1-0) molecular clumps. The density and velocity gradients imply strong stellar winds from exciting stars, this is consistent with the morphology of molecular cloud. The 12CO(J = 1-0) spectra show broad blue wings with a width of about 3.5 km s-1. We suggest that the broad blue wings could be emission from the molecular gas shocked by stellar winds, while the main narrow component may originate from pre-shocked gas. Several bright bow-shaped rims have been detected at 12 mum, which serve as the interface of the molecular cloud facing UV dissipation from the exciting stars. The rims all have an orientation facing IL Cep, this may indicate the pre-dominant effects of IL Cep on its surroundings. A very young star candidate (about 104.8 yr) was found in the head of one bright rim, but its triggered origin is uncertain. All results achieved in this paper suggest that IL Cep has violent effects on its surroundings.},

	Abstract = {We present 1.3mm Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations at $\sim$3$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution towards the brightest section of the intermediate/massive star forming cluster NGC 2264-C. The millimetre continuum emission reveals ten 1.3mm continuum peaks, of which four are new detections. The observed frequency range includes the known molecular jet/outflow tracer SiO (5-4), thus providing the first high resolution observations of SiO towards NGC 2264-C. We also detect molecular lines of twelve additional species towards this region, including CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$OH, SO, H$_2$CO, DCN, HC$_3$N, and $^{12}$CO. The SiO (5-4) emission reveals the presence of two collimated, high velocity (up to 30kms$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic velocity) bi-polar outflows in NGC 2264-C. In addition, the outflows are traced by emission from $^{12}$CO, SO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH. We find an evolutionary spread between cores residing in the same parent cloud. The two unambiguous outflows are driven by the brightest mm continuum cores, which are IR-dark, molecular line weak, and likely the youngest cores in the region. Furthermore, towards the RMS source AFGL 989-IRS1, the IR-bright and most evolved source in NGC 2264-C, we observe no molecular outflow emission. A molecular line rich ridge feature, with no obvious directly associated continuum source, lies on the edge of a low density cavity and may be formed from a wind driven by AFGL 989-IRS1. In addition, 229GHz class I maser emission is detected towards this feature.},

	Abstract = {One of the key questions in the field of star formation is the role of stellar feedback on subsequent star formation process. The W3 giant molecular cloud complex at the western border of the W4 super bubble is thought to be influenced by the stellar winds of the massive stars in W4. AFGL333 is a ~10^4 Msun cloud within W3. This paper presents a study of the star formation activity within AFGL333 using deep JHKs photometry obtained from the NOAO Extremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager combined with Spitzer-IRAC-MIPS photometry. Based on the infrared excess, we identify 812 candidate young stellar objects in the complex, of which 99 are classified as Class I and 713 are classified as Class II sources. The stellar density analysis of young stellar objects reveals three major stellar aggregates within AFGL333, named here AFGL333-main, AFGL333-NW1 and AFGL333-NW2. The disk fraction within AFGL333 is estimated to be ~50-60%. We use the extinction map made from the H-Ks colors of the background stars to understand the cloud structure and to estimate the cloud mass. The CO-derived extinction map corroborates the cloud structure and mass estimates from NIR color method. From the stellar mass and cloud mass associated with AFGL333, we infer that the region is currently forming stars with an efficiency of ~4.5% and at a rate of ~2 - 3 Msun Myr-1pc-2. In general, the star formation activity within AFGL333 is comparable to that of nearby low mass star-forming regions. We do not find any strong evidence to suggest that the stellar feedback from the massive stars of nearby W4 super bubble has affected the global star formation properties of the AFGL333 region.},

	Abstract = {Large interstellar organic molecules are potential precursors of prebiotic molecules. Their formation pathways and chemical relationships with one another and simpler molecules are therefore of great interest. In this paper, we address the relationship between two classes of large organic molecules, carbon chains and saturated complex organic molecules (COMs), at the early stages of star formation through observations of C4H and CH3OH. We surveyed these molecules with the IRAM 30m telescope toward 16 deeply embedded low-mass protostars selected from the Spitzer c2d ice survey. We find that CH3OH and C4H are positively correlated indicating that these two classes of molecules can coexist during the embedded protostellar stage. The C4H/CH3OH gas abundance ratio tentatively correlates with the CH4/CH3OH ice abundance ratio in the same lines of sight. This relationship supports a scenario where carbon chain formation in protostellar envelopes begins with CH4 ice desorption.},

	Abstract = {The all-Galaxy CO survey of Dame, Hartmann, & Thaddeus (2001) is by far the most uniform, large-scale Galactic CO survey. Using a dendrogram-based decomposition of this survey, we present a catalog of 1064 massive molecular clouds throughout the Galactic plane. This catalog contains $2.5 \times 10^8$ solar masses, or $25^{+10.7}_{-5.8} \%$ of the Milky Way's estimated H$_2$ mass. We track clouds in some spiral arms through multiple quadrants. The power index of Larson's first law, the size-linewidth relation, is consistent with 0.5 in all regions - possibly due to an observational bias - but clouds in the inner Galaxy systematically have significantly (~ 30%) higher linewidths at a given size, indicating that their linewidths are set in part by Galactic environment. The mass functions of clouds in the inner Galaxy versus the outer Galaxy are both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct. The inner Galaxy mass spectrum is best described by a truncated power-law with a power index of $\gamma=-1.6\pm0.1$ and an upper truncation mass $M_0 = (1.0 \pm 0.2) \times 10^7 M_\odot$, while the outer Galaxy mass spectrum is better described by a non-truncating power law with $\gamma=-2.2\pm0.1$ and an upper mass $M_0 = (1.5 \pm 0.5) \times 10^6 M_\odot$, indicating that the inner Galaxy is able to form and host substantially more massive GMCs than the outer Galaxy. Additionally, we have simulated how the Milky Way would appear in CO from extragalactic perspectives, for comparison with CO maps of other galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) have central stellar mass surface densities exceeding $10^{4} M_{\odot} pc^{-2}$. It is currently unknown whether the stars formed at such high (proto)stellar densities. We compile a sample of gas clouds in the Galaxy which have sufficient gas mass within a radius of a few parsecs to form a YMC, and compare their radial gas mass distributions to the stellar mass distribution of Galactic YMCs. We find that the gas in the progenitor clouds is distributed differently than the stars in YMCs. The mass surface density profiles of the gas clouds are generally shallower than the stellar mass surface density profiles of the YMCs, which are characterised by prominent dense core regions with radii ~ 0.1 pc, followed by a power-law tail. On the scale of YMC core radii, we find that there are no known clouds with significantly more mass in their central regions when compared to Galactic YMCs. Additionally, we find that models in which stars form from very dense initial conditions require surface densities that are generally higher than those seen in the known candidate YMC progenitor clouds. Our results show that the quiescent, less evolved clouds contain less mass in their central regions than in the highly star-forming clouds. This suggests an evolutionary trend in which clouds continue to accumulate mass towards their centres after the onset of star formation. We conclude that a conveyor-belt scenario for YMC formation is consistent with the current sample of Galactic YMCs and their progenitor clouds.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalogue of dense cores in a $\sim 4^\circ\times2^\circ$ field of the Taurus star-forming region, inclusive of the L1495 cloud, derived from Herschel SPIRE and PACS observations in the 70 $\mu$m, 160 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 350 $\mu$m, and 500 $\mu$m continuum bands. Estimates of mean dust temperature and total mass are derived using modified blackbody fits to the spectral energy distributions. We detect 528 starless cores of which $\sim10$-20% are gravitationally bound and therefore presumably prestellar. Our census of unbound objects is $\sim85$% complete for $M>0.015\,M_\odot$ in low density regions ($A_V\stackrel{<}{_\sim}5$ mag), while the bound (prestellar) subset is $\sim85$% complete for $M>0.1\,M_\odot$ overall. The prestellar core mass function (CMF) is consistent with lognormal form, resembling the stellar system initial mass function, as has been reported previously. All of the inferred prestellar cores lie on filamentary structures whose column densities exceed the expected threshold for filamentary collapse, in agreement with previous reports. Unlike the prestellar CMF, the unbound starless CMF is not lognormal, but instead is consistent with a power-law form below $0.3\,M_\odot$ and shows no evidence for a low-mass turnover. It resembles previously reported mass distributions for CO clumps at low masses ($M\stackrel{<}{_\sim}0.3\,M_\odot$). The volume density PDF, however, is accurately lognormal except at high densities. It is consistent with the effects of self-gravity on magnetized supersonic turbulence. The only significant deviation from lognormality is a high-density tail which can be attributed unambiguously to prestellar cores.},

	Abstract = {Observations of nearby molecular clouds detect ``shells,'' which are likely caused by winds from young main sequence stars. However, the progenitors of these observed features are not well characterized and the mass-loss rates inferred from the gas kinematics are several orders of magnitude greater than those predicted by atomic line-driven stellar wind models. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to model winds launching within turbulent molecular clouds and explore the impact of wind properties on cloud morphology and turbulence. We find that winds do not produce clear features in turbulent statistics such as the Fourier spectra of density and momentum but do impact the Fourier velocity spectrum. The density and velocity distribution functions, especially as probed by CO spectral lines, strongly indicate the presence and influence of winds. We show that stellar mass-loss rates for individual stars must be {\dot{m}}w≳ {10}-7 {M}&sun;  yr-1, similar to those estimated from observations, to reproduce shell properties. Consequently, we conclude that B and A-type main sequence stars have mass-loss rates several orders of magnitude larger that those predicted by models or that young stars are more variable than expected due to magnetic activity or accretion.},

	Abstract = {We report the CO(J = 1-0) observations of the Whirlpool Galaxy M51 using both the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) and the Nobeyama 45 m telescope (NRO45). We describe a procedure for the combination of interferometer and single-dish data. In particular, we discuss (1) the joint imaging and deconvolution of heterogeneous data, (2) the weighting scheme based on the root-mean-square (rms) noise in the maps, (3) the sensitivity and uv coverage requirements, and (4) the flux recovery of a combined map. We generate visibilities from the single-dish map and calculate the noise of each visibility based on the rms noise. Our weighting scheme, though it is applied to discrete visibilities in this paper, should be applicable to grids in uv space, and this scheme may advance in future software development. For a realistic amount of observing time, the sensitivities of the NRO45 and CARMA visibility data sets are best matched by using the single-dish baselines only up to 4-6 klambda (about 1/4-1/3 of the dish diameter). The synthesized beam size is determined to conserve the flux between the synthesized beam and convolution beam. The superior uv coverage provided by the combination of CARMA long baseline data with 15 antennas and NRO45 short spacing data results in the high image fidelity, which is evidenced by the excellent overlap between even the faint CO emission and dust lanes in an optical Hubble Space Telescope image and polycyclicaromatichydrocarbon emission in a Spitzer 8 mum image. The total molecular gas masses of NGC 5194 and 5195 (d = 8.2 Mpc) are 4.9 × 109 M sun and 7.8 × 107 M sun, respectively, assuming the CO-to-H2 conversion factor of X CO = 1.8 × 1020 cm-2(K km s-1)-1. The presented images are an indication of the millimeter-wave images that will become standard in the next decade with CARMA and NRO45, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array.},

	Abstract = {ALMA observations show a non-detection of carbon monoxide around the four most luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Stellar evolution models and star counts show that the mass-loss rates from these stars should be ~1.2-3.5 x 10^-7 solar masses per year. We would naively expect such stars to be detectable at this distance (4.5 kpc). By modelling the ultraviolet radiation field from post-AGB stars and white dwarfs in 47 Tuc, we conclude CO should be dissociated abnormally close to the stars. We estimate that the CO envelopes will be truncated at a few hundred stellar radii from their host stars and that the line intensities are about two orders of magnitude below our current detection limits. The truncation of CO envelopes should be important for AGB stars in dense clusters. Observing the CO (3-2) and higher transitions and targeting stars far from the centres of clusters should result in the detections needed to measure the outflow velocities from these stars.},

We perform global, three dimensional dusty smoothed particle hydrodynamics calculations of multiple planets embedded in dust/gas discs which successfully reproduce most of the structures seen in the ALMA image. We find a best match to the observations using three embedded planets with masses of 0.2, 0.27 and 0.55 $M_{\rm J}$ in the three main gaps observed by ALMA, though there remain uncertainties in the exact planet masses from the disc model.},

@article{Manoj13,
	Abstract = {We present far-infrared (57-196 mum) spectra of 21 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds. These were obtained with the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) on board the Herschel Space observatory as part of the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey program. We analyzed the emission lines from rotational transitions of CO, involving rotational quantum numbers in the range J up = 14-46, using PACS spectra extracted within a projected distance of lsim2000 AU centered on the protostar. The total luminosity of the CO lines observed with PACS (L CO) is found to increase with increasing protostellar luminosity (L bol). However, no significant correlation is found between L CO and evolutionary indicators or envelope properties of the protostars such as bolometric temperature, T bol, or envelope density. The CO rotational (excitation) temperature implied by the line ratios increases with increasing rotational quantum number J, and at least 3-4 rotational temperature components are required to fit the observed rotational diagram in the PACS wavelength range. The rotational temperature components are remarkably invariant between protostars and show no dependence on L bol, T bol, or envelope density, implying that if the emitting gas is in local thermodynamic equilibrium, the CO emission must arise in multiple temperature components that remain independent of L bol over two orders of magnitudes. The observed CO emission can also be modeled as arising from a single-temperature gas component or from a medium with a power-law temperature distribution; both of these require sub-thermally excited molecular gas at low densities (n(H2) <~ 106 cm-3) and high temperatures (T gsim 2000 K). Our results suggest that the contribution from photodissociation regions, produced along the envelope cavity walls from UV-heating, is unlikely to be the dominant component of the CO emission observed with PACS. Instead, the "universality" of the rotational temperatures and the observed correlation between L CO and L bol can most easily be explained if the observed CO emission originates in shock-heated, hot (T >~ 2000 K), sub-thermally excited (n(H2) <~ 106 cm-3) molecular gas. Post-shock gas at these densities is more likely to be found within the outflow cavities along the molecular outflow or along the cavity walls at radii >~ several 100-1000 AU.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

@article{Stutz15,
	Abstract = {We compare the structure of star-forming molecular clouds in different regions of Orion A to determine how the column density probability distribution function (N-PDF) varies with environmental conditions such as the fraction of young protostars. A correlation between the N-PDF slope and Class 0 protostar fraction has been previously observed in a low-mass star-formation region (Perseus); here we test whether a similar correlation is observed in a high-mass star-forming region. We used Herschel PACS and SPIRE cold dust emission observations to derive a column density map of Orion A. We used the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey catalog to accurately identify and classify the Orion A young stellar object content, including the cold and relatively short-lived Class 0 protostars (with a lifetime of ~0.14 Myr). We divided Orion A into eight independent regions of 0.25 square degrees (13.5 pc2); in each region we fit the N-PDF distribution with a power law, and we measured the fraction of Class 0 protostars. We used a maximum-likelihood method to measure the N-PDF power-law index without binning the column density data. We find that the Class 0 fraction is higher in regions with flatter column density distributions. We tested the effects of incompleteness, extinction-driven misclassification of Class 0 sources, resolution, and adopted pixel-scales. We show that these effects cannot account for the observed trend. Our observations demonstrate an association between the slope of the power-law N-PDF and the Class 0 fractions within Orion A. Various interpretations are discussed, including timescales based on the Class 0 protostar fraction assuming a constant star-formation rate. The observed relation suggests that the N-PDF can be related to an evolutionary state of the gas. If universal, such a relation permits evaluating the evolutionary state from the N-PDF power-law index at much greater distances than those accessible with protostar counts.

	Abstract = {Walfraven photometry of established and probable members of the Orion OB1 association is presented. Effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity and mass are derived for all stars, using atmosphere model by Kurucz (1979). Absolute magnitudes are calculated using the Straizys and Kuriliene (1981) tables. Distance moduli and visual extinctions are determined. A comparison of the visual extinctions to IRAS 100 micrometers data shows that the near edge of the Orion A and B clouds lies at a distance of approximately 320 pc, while the far edge is at approximately 500 pc. A method for deriving the ages of the subgroups by comparing theoretical isochrones to the observations in the log g, log Teff plane is presented. The derived ages suggest, contrary to earlier studies, that subgroup 1b is younger than 1c, which can possibly be explained by past geometries of the system of stars and gas. The initial mass function for Orion OB1 is derived with the aid of the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. Through extensive simulations, we show that it is very difficult to derive accurately the Initial Mass Function (IMF) from the available data. To within somewhat weak limits the IMF is found to be of the form xi(log M) = AM-1.7 +/- 0.2 for all subgroups. The energy output of the subgroups in the form of stellar winds and supernovae is calculated and compared to the observed size and expansion velocity of the Orion-Eridanus bubble. It is shown that the energy output of the association can account for the morphology and kinematics of the interstellar medium (ISM).},

	Abstract = {There is evidence that the young Sun emitted a high flux of energetic (>=10 MeV) particles. The collisions of these particles with the material at the inner edge of the Protosolar Nebula disk induced spallation reactions that formed short-lived radionuclei, like 10Be, whose trace is now visible in some meteorites. However, it is poorly known exactly when this happened, and whether and how it affected the solar system. Here, we present indirect evidence for an ejection of energetic particles in the young protostar, OMC-2 FIR 4, similar to that experienced by the young solar system. In this case, the energetic particles collide with the material in the protostellar envelope, enhancing the abundance of two molecular ions, HCO+ and N2H+, whose presence is detected via Herschel observations. The flux of energetic particles at a distance of 1 AU from the emitting source, estimated from the measured abundance ratio of HCO+ and N2H+, can easily account for the irradiation required by meteoritic observations. These new observations demonstrate that the ejection of >=10 MeV particles is a phenomenon occurring very early in the life of a protostar, before the disappearance of the envelope from which the future star accretes. The whole envelope is affected by the event, which sets constraints on the magnetic field geometry in the source and opens up the possibility that the spallation reactions are not limited to the inner edge of the Protosolar Nebula disk.},

	Abstract = {We use mid-infrared to submillimeter data from the Spitzer, Herschel, and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescopes to study the bright submillimeter source OMC-2 FIR 4. We find a point source at 8, 24, and 70 mum, and a compact, but extended source at 160, 350, and 870 mum. The peak of the emission from 8 to 70 mum, attributed to the protostar associated with FIR 4, is displaced relative to the peak of the extended emission; the latter represents the large molecular core the protostar is embedded within. We determine that the protostar has a bolometric luminosity of 37 L &sun;, although including more extended emission surrounding the point source raises this value to 86 L &sun;. Radiative transfer models of the protostellar system fit the observed spectral energy distribution well and yield a total luminosity of most likely less than 100 L &sun;. Our models suggest that the bolometric luminosity of the protostar could be as low as 12-14 L &sun;, while the luminosity of the colder (~20 K) extended core could be around 100 L &sun;, with a mass of about 27 M &sun;. Our derived luminosities for the protostar OMC-2 FIR 4 are in direct contradiction with previous claims of a total luminosity of 1000 L &sun;. Furthermore, we find evidence from far-infrared molecular spectra and 3.6 cm emission that FIR 4 drives an outflow. The final stellar mass the protostar will ultimately achieve is uncertain due to its association with the large reservoir of mass found in the cold core.},

	Abstract = {We present a new set of analytic models for the expansion of HII regions powered by UV photoionisation from massive stars and compare them to a new suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating molecular clouds. To perform these simulations we use RAMSES-RT, an Eulerian adaptive mesh magnetohydrodynamics code with radiative transfer of UV photons. We find two models that fit the simulation results well, and give a physically-motivated criterion for determining which of the models should be used. In one model, the ionisation front is only resisted by the ram pressure from the external medium, which we model as a spherically symmetric power law model. In the other, the front stalls at an equilibrium radius at which the ram pressure from accretion or turbulence in the cloud is balanced by the thermal pressure of the photoionised gas. If this stalling radius is larger than the radius of the cloud, the ionisation front can escape the cloud and expand freely in most directions. Otherwise, the front stalls at the predicted radius. We also measure the response of Jeans unstable gas to the HII regions to predict the impact of UV radiation on star formation in the cloud. We find that the mass in unstable gas can be explained by a model in which the clouds are evaporated by UV photons, suggesting that the net feedback on star formation should be negative.},

	Abstract = {We present results from an optical photometric and spectroscopic survey of the young stellar population in L1641, the low-density star-forming region of the Orion A cloud south of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Our goal is to determine whether L1641 has a large enough low-mass population to make the known lack of high-mass stars a statistically significant demonstration of environmental dependence of the upper mass stellar initial mass function (IMF). Our spectroscopic sample consists of IR-excess objects selected from the Spitzer/IRAC survey and non-excess objects selected from optical photometry. We have spectral confirmation of 864 members, with another 98 probable members; of the confirmed members, 406 have infrared excesses and 458 do not. Assuming the same ratio of stars with and without IR excesses in the highly extincted regions, L1641 may contain as many as ~1600 stars down to ~0.1 M &sun;, comparable within a factor of two to the ONC. Compared to the standard models of the IMF, L1641 is deficient in O and early B stars to a 3sigma-4sigma significance level, assuming that we know of all the massive stars in L1641. With a forthcoming survey of the intermediate-mass stars, we will be in a better position to make a direct comparison with the neighboring, dense ONC, which should yield a stronger test of the dependence of the high-mass end of the stellar IMF on environment.},

	Abstract = {We present the first study of the relationship between the column density distribution of molecular clouds within nearby Galactic spiral arms and their evolutionary status as measured from their stellar content. We analyze a sample of 195 molecular clouds located at distances below 5.5 kpc, identified from the ATLASGAL 870 micron data. We define three evolutionary classes within this sample: starless clumps, star-forming clouds with associated young stellar objects, and clouds associated with HII regions. We find that the N(H2) probability density functions (N-PDFs) of these three classes of objects are clearly different: the N-PDFs of starless clumps are narrowest and close to log-normal in shape, while star-forming clouds and HII regions exhibit a power-law shape over a wide range of column densities and log-normal-like components only at low column densities. We use the N-PDFs to estimate the evolutionary time-scales of the three classes of objects based on a simple analytic model from literature. Finally, we show that the integral of the N-PDFs, the dense gas mass fraction, depends on the total mass of the regions as measured by ATLASGAL: more massive clouds contain greater relative amounts of dense gas across all evolutionary classes.},

	Abstract = {Magnitudes and color indices of 430 stars down to V ˜ 17.5 mag in the eight-color Vilnius + I photometric system were obtained in four areas of diameter 20' within the dark cloud L935 separating the North America and Pelican nebulae. Spectral types, interstellar color excesses, extinctions and distances of stars were determined from the photometric data. The plot of extinction vs. distance shows that the dark cloud begins at a distance of 520$\pm$50 pc. About 40 stars in the cloud, mostly K and M dwarfs, are suspected to have Halpha emission; these stars also exhibit infrared excesses. Four of them are known pre-main-sequence stars. Our star set contains J205551.3+435225 (V = 13.24) which, according to Camer{\'o}n and Pasquali (2005), is the O5 V type star ionizing the North America and Pelican nebulae. If this spectral type is confirmed, the star would have an extinction AV between 9 and 10 magnitudes (depending on the accepted extinction law) and a distance which is not very different from the dust cloud distance.},

We incorporate the MIPS observations with earlier Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) observations, as well as archival near-infrared (IR) and optical data. We use the MIPS data to identify 1286 young stellar object (YSO) candidates. IRAC data alone can identify 806 more YSO candidates, for a total of 2076 YSO candidates. Prior to the Spitzer observations, there were only ~200 YSOs known in this region. Three subregions within the complex are highlighted as clusters: the Gulf of Mexico, the Pelican, and the Pelican's Hat. The Gulf of Mexico cluster is subject to the highest extinction (AV at least ~30) and has the widest range of infrared colors of the three clusters, including the largest excesses and by far the most point-source detections at 70 mum. Just 3% of the cluster members were previously identified; we have redefined this cluster as about 10-100 times larger (in projected area) than was previously realized.},

@article{Bally80,
	Abstract = {This paper reports 12CO observations of a fragmented, expanding cloud network surrounding an old H II region, W80. Systematic velocity gradients and line splitting indicate the presence of a 3-6 × 104 Msun molecular shell expanding with a velocity V = 5 km s-1 from a point centered near the peak of the radio f-f emission. We interpret this feature as the remnant of the ionization shock front system from the evolving H II region which was formed off-center in the original molecular cloud. A simple model is constructed to follow the evolution of the shocked gas layer through three phases: (1) the Str{\"o}mgren phase in which a weak D-type front accumulates material; (2) a decompression phase during which the ionized gas pressure drops after the H II region bursts through its nearest cloud boundary; and (3) the rocket phase. The last stage, in which we identify the Pelican nebula, occurs several million years after the birth of the Str{\"o}mgren sphere, when the shock has reached the back side of the molecular cloud and the neutral layer is accelerated by ionization and evaporation of H2 into the H II region.  The molecular gas shell appears extensively fragmented with numerous holes and several hot spots or cores with TA*(CO) ≈ 25 K. Extensive star formation has occurred here; there are many T Tauri and young emission-line stars embedded in the peripheral clouds and an infrared source is associated with one of the CO hot spots seen at the periphery of the H II region. Some of these stars presumably formed in the expanding H2 shell.  These observations address the issue of destruction of molecular clouds when H II regions form within them. W80 is located at the extremity of a larger giant molecular cloud. In this case only a small part of the original giant cloud is being dissociated. Much of the gas has survived as accelerated molecular fragments.},

	Abstract = {During their infancy, stars are well known to expel matter violently in the form of well-defined, collimated outflows. A fairly unique exception is found in the Orion Becklin-Neugebauer/Kleinmann-Low star-forming region where a poorly collimated and somewhat disordered outflow composed of numerous elongated "finger-like" structures was discovered more than 30 years ago. In this Letter, we report the discovery in the same region of an even more atypical outflow phenomenon. Using 13CO(2-1) line observations made with the Submillimeter Array, we have identified there a 500-1000 year old, expanding, roughly spherically symmetric bubble whose characteristics are entirely different from those of known outflows associated with young stellar objects. The center of the bubble coincides with the initial position of a now defunct massive multiple stellar system suspected to have disintegrated 500 years ago and with the center of symmetry of the system of molecular fingers surrounding the Kleinmann-Low nebula. We hypothesize that the bubble is made up of gas and dust that used to be part of the circumstellar material associated with the decayed multiple system. The Orion hot core, recently proposed to be the result of the impact of a shock wave onto a massive dense core, is located toward the southeast quadrant of the bubble.

	Abstract = {We present line and continuum observations made with the Submillimeter Array of the young stellar object Barnard 5 - IRS1 located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Our 12CO(2-1) line observations resolve the high-velocity bipolar north-east-south-west outflow associated with this source. We find that the outflowing gas shows different structures at three different velocity regimes, in both lobes, resulting in a spider-like morphology. In addition to the low-velocity, cone-like (wide-angle) lobes that have previously been observed, we report the presence of intermediate-velocity parabolic shells emerging very close to the Class I protostar, as well as high-velocity molecular bullets that appear to be associated with the optical/IR jet emanating from this source. These compact high-velocity features reach radial velocities of about 50 km s-1 away from the cloud velocity. We interpret that the peculiar spider-like morphology is a result of the molecular material being entrained by a wind with both a collimated jet-like component and a wide-angle component. We suggest that the outflow is in a transitional evolutionary phase between a mostly jet-driven flow and an outflow in which the entrainment is dominated by the wide-angle wind component. We also detect 1300 mum continuum emission at the position of the protostar, which likely arises from the dusty envelope and disc surrounding the protostar. Finally, we report the detection of 13CO(2-1) and SO(65-54) emission arising from the outflow and the location of the young stellar object.},

	Abstract = {The Orion Molecular Complex is the nearest site of ongoing high-mass star formation, making it one of the most extensively studied molecular complexes in the Galaxy. We have developed a new technique for mapping the three-dimensional distribution of dust in the Galaxy using Pan-STARRS1 photometry. We isolate the dust at the distance to Orion using this technique, revealing a large (100 pc, 14$\,^{\circ}$ diameter), previously unrecognized ring of dust, which we term the "Orion dust ring." The ring includes Orion A and B, and is not coincident with current Halpha features. The circular morphology suggests formation as an ancient bubble in the interstellar medium, though we have not been able to conclusively identify the source of the bubble. This hint at the history of Orion may have important consequences for models of high-mass star formation and triggered star formation.},

	Abstract = {Yellowballs are a collection of approximately 900 compact, infrared sources identified and named by volunteers participating in the Milky Way Project (MWP), a citizen science project that uses GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL images from Spitzer to explore topics related to Galactic star formation. In this paper, through a combination of catalog cross-matching and infrared color analysis, we show that yellowballs are a mix of compact star-forming regions, including ultra-compact and compact H II regions, as well as analogous regions for less massive B-type stars. The resulting MWP yellowball catalog provides a useful complement to the Red MSX Source survey. It similarly highlights regions of massive star formation, but the selection of objects purely on the basis of their infrared morphology and color in Spitzer images identifies a signature of compact star-forming regions shared across a broad range of luminosities and, by inference, masses. We discuss the origin of their striking mid-infrared appearance and suggest that future studies of the yellowball sample will improve our understanding of how massive and intermediate-mass star-forming regions transition from compact to more extended bubble-like structures.},

	Abstract = {A review of star formation in the Rho Ophiuchi molecular complex is presented, with particular emphasis on studies of the main cloud, L1688, since 1991.  Recent photometric and parallax measurements of stars in the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Sco-Cen OB association suggest a distance for the cloud between 120 and 140 parsecs.  Star formation is ongoing in the dense cores of L1688 with a median age for young stellar objects of 0.3 Myr.  The surface population appears to have a median age of 2-5 Myr and merges with low mass stars in the Upper Scorpius subgroup. Making use of the most recent X-ray and infrared photometric surveys and spectroscopic surveys of L1688, we compile a list of over 300 association members with counterparts in the 2MASS catalog. Membership criteria, such as lithium absorption, X-ray emission, and infrared excess, cover the full range of evolutionary states for young stellar objects.  Spectral energy distributions are classified for many association members using infrared photometry obtained from the Spitzer Space Telescope.},

	Abstract = {Infrared stellar photometry from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and spectral line imaging observations of 12CO and 13CO J = 1-0 line emission from the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) 14-m telescope are analysed to assess the variation of the CO abundance with physical conditions throughout the Orion A and Orion B molecular clouds. Three distinct Av regimes are identified in which the ratio between the 13CO column density and visual extinction changes corresponding to the photon-dominated envelope, the strongly self-shielded interior, and the cold, dense volumes of the clouds. Within the strongly self-shielded interior of the Orion A cloud, the 13CO abundance varies by 100 per cent with a peak value located near regions of enhanced star formation activity. The effect of CO depletion on to the ice mantles of dust grains is limited to regions with Av > 10 mag and gas temperatures less than ˜20 K as predicted by chemical models that consider thermal evaporation to desorb molecules from grain surfaces.  Values of the molecular mass of each cloud are independently derived from the distributions of Av and 13CO column densities with a constant 13CO-to-H2 abundance over various extinction ranges. Within the strongly self-shielded interior of the cloud (Av> 3 mag), 13CO provides a reliable tracer of H2 mass with the exception of the cold, dense volumes where depletion is important. However, owing to its reduced abundance, 13CO does not trace the H2 mass that resides in the extended cloud envelope, which comprises 40-50 per cent of the molecular mass of each cloud. The implied CO luminosity to mass ratios, M/LCO, are 3.2 and 2.9 for Orion A and Orion B, respectively, which are comparable to the value (2.9), derived from gamma-ray observations of the Orion region. Our results emphasize the need to consider local conditions when applying CO observations to derive H2 column densities.},

	Abstract = {Context. Bubble N107 was discovered in the infrared emission of dust in the plane of the Milk y Way Galaxy observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope (GLIMPSE survey: l ≈ 51.̊0, b ≈ 0.̊1). The bubble represents an example of shell-like structures found all over the Milky Way Galaxy.  Aims: We aim to analyse the atomic and molecular components of N107, as well as its radio continuum emission. With the help of numerical simulations, we aim to estimate the bubble's age and other parameters that cannot be derived directly from observations.  Methods: From the observations of the H i (I-GALFA) and 13CO (GRS) lines we derive the bubble's kinematical distance and masses of the atomic and molecular components. With the algorithm DENDROFIND, we decompose molecular material into individual clumps. From the continuum observations at 1420 MHz (VGPS) and 327 MHz (WSRT), we derive the radio flux density and the spectral index. With the numerical code ring, we simulate the evolution of stellar-blown bubbles similar to N107.  Results: The total H i mass associated with N107 is 5.4 × 103 M&sun;. The total mass of the molecular component (a mixture of cold gasses of H2, CO, He, and heavier elements) is 1.3 × 105 M&sun;, from which 4.0 × 104 M&sun; is found along the bubble border. We identified 49 molecular clumps distributed along the bubble's border, with the slope of the clump mass function of -1.1. The spectral index of -0.30 of a strong radio source located apparently within the bubble indicates nonthermal emission, hence part of the flux probably originates in a supernova remnant, not yet catalogued. The numerical simulations suggest N107 is most likely less than 2.25 Myr old. Since the first supernovae explode only after 3 Myr or later, no supernova remnant should be present within the bubble. It may be explained if there is a supernova remnant in the direction towards the bubble, however not associated with it.},

Aims: We attempt to determine the nature of the bubbles observed by Spitzer in the Galactic plane, mainly to establish if possible their association with massive stars. We take advantage of the very simple morphology of these objects to search for star formation triggered by H ii regions, and to estimate the importance of this mode of star formation.  Methods: We consider a sample of 102 bubbles detected by Spitzer-GLIMPSE, and catalogued by Churchwell et al. (2006; hereafter CH06). We use mid-infrared and radio-continuum public data (respectively the Spitzer-GLIMPSE and -MIPSGAL surveys and the MAGPIS and VGPS surveys) to discuss their nature. We use the ATLASGAL survey at 870 mum to search for dense neutral material collected on their borders. The 870 mum data traces the distribution of cold dust, thus of the dense neutral material where stars may form.  Results: We find that 86% of the bubbles contain ionized gas detected by means of its radio-continuum emission at 20-cm. Thus, most of the bubbles observed at 8.0 mum enclose H ii regions ionized by O-B2 stars. This finding differs from the earlier CH06 results (~25% of the bubbles enclosing H ii regions). Ninety-eight percent of the bubbles exhibit 24 mum emission in their central regions. The ionized regions at the center of the 8.0 mum bubbles seem to be devoid of PAHs but contain hot dust. PAH emission at 8.0 mum is observed in the direction of the photodissociation regions surrounding the ionized gas. Among the 65 regions for which the angular resolution of the observations is high enough to resolve the spatial distribution of cold dust at 870 mum, we find that 40% are surrounded by cold dust, and that another 28% contain interacting condensations. The former are good candidates for the collect and collapse process, as they display an accumulation of dense material at their borders. The latter are good candidates for the compression of pre-existing condensations by the ionized gas. Thirteen bubbles exhibit associated ultracompact H ii regions in the direction of dust condensations adjacent to their ionization fronts. Another five show methanol masers in similar condensations.  Conclusions: Our results suggest that more than a quarter of the bubbles may have triggered the formation of massive objects. Therefore, star formation triggered by H ii regions may be an important process, especially for massive-star formation.  Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {Context: Ionizing radiation plays a crucial role in star formation at all epochs. In contemporary star formation, ionization abruptly raises the pressure by more than three orders of magnitude; the temperature increases from ~10~K to ~10^4~K, and the mean molecular weight decreases by a factor of more than 3. This may result in positive feedback, either by compressing pre-existing clouds and rendering them unstable, or by sweeping up gravitationally unstable shells. It may also result in negative feedback (by dispersing residual dense gas). Ionizing radiation from OB stars is also routinely invoked as a means of injecting kinetic energy into the interstellar medium and as a driver of sequential self-propagating star formation in galaxies.  Aims: We describe a new algorithm for including the dynamical effects of ionizing radiation in SPH simulations, and we present several examples of how the algorithm can be applied to problems in star formation.  Methods: We use the HEALPix software to tessellate the sky and to solve the equation of ionization equilibrium along a ray towards each of the resulting tesserae. We exploit the hierarchical nature of HEALPix to make the algorithm adaptive, so that fine angular resolution is invoked only where it is needed, and the computational cost is kept low.  Results: We present simulations of (i) the spherically symmetric expansion of an Hii region inside a uniform-density, non-self-gravitating cloud; (ii) the spherically symmetric expansion of an Hii region inside a uniform-density, self-gravitating cloud; (iii) the expansion of an off-centre Hii region inside a uniform-density, non-self-gravitating cloud, resulting in rocket acceleration and dispersal of the cloud; and (iv) radiatively driven compression and ablation of a core overrun by an Hii region.  Conclusions: The new algorithm provides the means to explore and evaluate the role of ionizing radiation in regulating the efficiency and statistics of star formation.},

We reduced the data with the public MUSE pipeline. The output products are two FITS cubes with a spatial size of ~5.9'x4.9' (corresponding to ~0.76 pc x 0.63 pc) and a contiguous wavelength coverage of 4595...9366 Angstrom, spatially sampled at 0.2". We provide two versions with a sampling of 1.25 Angstrom and 0.85 Angstrom in dispersion direction. Together with variance cubes these files have a size of 75 and 110 GiB on disk. They represent one of the largest integral field mosaics to date in terms of information content. We make them available for use in the community. To validate this dataset, we compare world coordinates, reconstructed magnitudes, velocities, and absolute and relative emission line fluxes to the literature and find excellent agreement. We derive a two-dimensional map of extinction and present de-reddened flux maps of several individual emission lines and of diagnostic line ratios. We estimate physical properties of the Orion Nebula, using the emission line ratios [N II] and [S III] (for the electron temperature $T_e$) and [S II] and [Cl III] (for the electron density $N_e$), and show two-dimensional images of the velocity measured from several bright emission lines.},

	Abstract = {Protostellar outflows can inject sufficient mass, momentum, and kinetic energy into their parent star-forming clumps to dramatically alter their structure, generate turbulence, and even to disrupt them. Outflows represent the lowest rung on a `feedback ladder' consisting of increasingly powerful mechanisms which kick-in if star formation escalates towards the production of more massive stars, higher efficiency, and larger clusters. Outflow feedback may dominate turbulence generation and cloud disruption on the scale of cluster-forming clumps having dimensions up to a few parsecs. Outflows inject energy and momentum on a wide-range of length-scales from less than 0.01 pc to over 30 pc. However, they fail by several orders of magnitude to inject sufficient momentum and kinetic energy to drive turbulent motions on the size and mass-scales of GMCs. Injection from higher rungs on the feedback ladder or momentum injected by Galactic-scale processes are needed to power the observed turbulence on the 10 to 100 pc scales of GMCs.},

	Abstract = {Massive stars shape the surrounding interstellar matter (ISM) by emitting ionizing photons and ejecting material through stellar winds. To study the impact of the momentum from the wind of a massive star on the surrounding neutral or ionized material, we implemented a new HEALPix-based momentum-conserving wind scheme in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code SEREN. A qualitative study of the impact of the feedback from an O7.5-like star on a self-gravitating sphere shows that on its own, the transfer of momentum from a wind onto cold surrounding gas has both a compressing and dispersing effect. It mostly affects gas at low and intermediate densities. When combined with a stellar source's ionizing ultraviolet (UV) radiation, we find the momentum-driven wind to have little direct effect on the gas. We conclude that during a massive star's main sequence, the UV ionizing radiation is the main feedback mechanism shaping and compressing the cold gas. Overall, the wind's effects on the dense gas dynamics and on the triggering of star formation are very modest. The structures formed in the ionization-only simulation and in the combined feedback simulation are remarkably similar. However, in the combined feedback case, different SPH particles end up being compressed. This indicates that the microphysics of gas mixing differ between the two feedback simulations and that the winds can contribute to the localized redistribution and reshuffling of gas.},

Orion is discussed in the larger context of star formation in the Solar vicinity over the last 100 Myr.  The Orion complex is located on the far side of the Gould's Belt system of clouds and young stars through which our Solar system is drifting.  A review is given of the overall structure and properties of the Orion star forming complex, the best studied OB association.  Over the last 12 Myr, Orion has given birth to at least ten thousand stars contained in a half dozen sub-groups and short-lived clusters.  The Orion OB association has been the source of several massive, high-velocity run-away stars, including mu Columbae and AE Aurigae.  Some of Orion's most massive members died in supernova explosions that created the 300 pc diameter Orion / Eridanus super-bubble whose near wall may be as close as 180 pc.  The combined effects of UV radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae have impacted surviving molecular clouds in Orion.  The large Orion A, IC 2118 molecular clouds and dozens of smaller clouds strewn throughout the interior of the superbubble have cometary shapes pointing back towards the center of the Orion OB association.  Most are forming stars in the compressed layers facing the bubble interior.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of near-infrared 2.12 mum molecular hydrogen outflows emerging from 1.1 mm dust continuum clumps in the North America and Pelican Nebula (NAP) complex selected from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). Hundreds of individual shocks powered by over 50 outflows from young stars are identified, indicating that the dusty molecular clumps surrounding the NGC 7000/IC 5070/W80 H II region are among the most active sites of ongoing star formation in the solar vicinity. A spectacular X-shaped outflow, MHO 3400, emerges from a young star system embedded in a dense clump more than a parsec from the ionization front associated with the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070). Suspected to be a binary, the source drives a pair of outflows with orientations differing by 80$\,^{\circ}$. Each flow exhibits S-shaped symmetry and multiple shocks indicating a pulsed and precessing jet. The "Gulf of Mexico," located south of the North America Nebula (NGC 7000), contains a dense cluster of molecular hydrogen objects (MHOs), Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, and over 300 young stellar objects (YSOs), indicating a recent burst of star formation. The largest outflow detected thus far in the North America and Pelican Nebula complex, the 1.6 parsec long MHO 3417 flow, emerges from a 500 M &sun; BGPS clump and may be powered by a forming massive star. Several prominent outflows such as MHO 3427 appear to be powered by highly embedded YSOs only visible at lambda > 70 mum. An "activity index" formed by dividing the number of shocks by the mass of the cloud containing their source stars is used to estimate the relative evolutionary states of Bolocam clumps. Outflows can be used as indicators of the evolutionary state of clumps detected in millimeter and submillimeter dust continuum surveys.},

	Abstract = {A large-scale (C-13)O map (containing 33,000 spectra on a 1-arcmin grid) is presented for the giant molecular cloud located in the southern part of Ori which contains the Ori Nebula, NGC 1977, and the L1641 dark cloud complex. The overall structure of the cloud is filamentary, with individual features having a length up to 40 times their width. The northern portion of the cloud is compressed, dynamically relaxed, and supports massive star formation. In contrast, the southern part of the Ori A cloud is diffuse, exhibits chaotic spatial and velocity structure, and supports only intermediate- to low-mass star formation. This morphology may be the consequence of the formation and evolution of the Ori OB I association centered north of the molecular cloud. The entire cloud, in addition to the 5000-solar-mass filament containing both OMC-1 and OMC-2, exhibits a north-south velocity gradient. Implications of the observed cloud morphology for theories of molecular cloud evolution are discussed.},

The east-west oriented flow contains two known HH objects (HH 280 and HH 317), two new HH objects (HH 492 and HH 493), and is 2.1 pc long. The flow is driven by the Class I protostar IRAS 03235+3004 embedded in a bright-rimmed, sharp-edged cometary cloud facing northeast. The flow source is embedded in a west-facing conical reflection nebula. The cometary cloud appears to have been shaped by O and B stars in the Per OB2 association, including the B0.5 star 40 Per, located along the well-defined symmetry axis of the cloud and with a projected separation of 26 pc. A soft-UV induced photoablation model is proposed to explain the properties of the cometary cloud.},

	Abstract = {Consideration is given to the turbulence properties of molecular clouds and their implications for star formation. Data for 54 molecular clouds and condensations is presented which reveals cloud velocity dispersion and region size to follow a power-law relation, similar to the Kolmogoroff law for subsonic turbulence. Examination of the dynamics of the molecular clouds for which mass determinations are available reveals essentially all of them to be gravitationally bound, and to approximately satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate scatter in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important role in producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to the size of subcondensations at which their internal motions are no longer supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar mass on the order of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive protostellar clumps are found to develop complex internal structures, probably leading to the formation of prestellar condensation nuclei. The observed turbulence of molecular clouds is noted to imply lifetimes of less than 10 million years.},

@article{Vazquez-Semadeni94,
	Abstract = {A purely statistical origin of hierarchical density structure in pressureless and nearly pressureless turbulent flows without self-gravity is proposed. It is argued that hydrodynamic (Navier-Stokes) flows with rms Mach numbers Mrms ≫ 1, like the cold interstellar medium or some cosmological flows, have a nearly pressureless behavior, except perhaps in a small fraction of the volume. Assuming that in these flows the density field can be considered as a random variable in time with an associated probability distribution function (pdf), a condition on the pdf for the spontaneous development of hierarchical structure is proposed. The condition is essentially a requirement that the joint probability of a succession of n constructively interfering relative density fluctuations of amplitude a be larger than the probability of a single, large fluctuation of the same final amplitude a . An analytic form for this condition is derived, under the assumption that the density pdf is scale- invariant, and three important functional forms of the pdf (a power-law, a lognormal, and an exponential distribution) are tested according to this criterion. It is found that development of hierarchical structure should always be expected for the lognormal and exponential distributions at large values of n and/or a, but is parameter-dependent in the case of the power law. The assumption of a scale-invariant density pdf is motivated (but not rigorously proved) by the scale invariance of the pressureless hydrodynamic equations with negligible self-gravity, and a numerical simulation of a compressible turbulent flow in two dimensions in a transonic regime (M ˜ 1) is used to test this and other secondary assumptions. The density field developed by the simulation clearly exhibits at least three levels of hierarchical nesting. The density statistics, albeit obscured by the limited resolution, which limits the feasible density contrasts, are shown to be consistent with the hypotheses. A discussion on the degree to which the dynamics of two- and three-dimensional flows may differ from one another in the compressible case is given. Finally, a remark is made that the hierarchical structure produced by this mechanism in turbulent compressible flows is transient although statistically stationary. This should be the case of all non-self-gravitating clouds in the cold interstellar medium and of small-scale structures in cosmological flows.},

@article{Nakamura07,
	Abstract = {We investigate the global properties of the outflow-driven protostellar turbulence through 3D MHD simulations. The simulations show that the turbulence in regions of active cluster formation is quickly transformed by the forming stars through protostellar outflows, and that strongly influences and perhaps controls protostellar turbulence cluster formation. We find that collimated outflows are more efficient in driving turbulence than spherical outflows that carry the same amounts of momentum. This is because collimated outflows can propagate farther away from their sources, effectively increasing the turbulence driving length; turbulence driven on a larger scale decays more slowly. Gravity plays an important role in shaping the turbulence, generating infall motions that balance the outward motions driven by outflows. The resulting quasi-equilibrium state is maintained through a slow rate of star formation, with a fraction of the total mass converted into stars per free-fall time as low as a few percent. Magnetic fields are dynamically important even in magnetically supercritical clumps, provided that their initial strengths are not far below the critical value for static cloud support. They contain an energy comparable to the turbulent energy and can significantly reduce the rate of star formation. The mass-weighted probability distribution function (PDF) of the volume density of the protostellar turbulence is often, although not always, approximately lognormal. The PDFs of the column density deviate more strongly from lognormal distributions. There is a prominent break in the power spectrum, which may provide a way to distinguish it from other types of turbulence.},

@article{Carroll10,
	Abstract = {Feedback from protostellar outflows can influence the nature of turbulence in star-forming regions even if they are not the primary source of velocity dispersion for all scales of molecular clouds. For the rate and power expected in star-forming regions, we previously (Carroll et al.) demonstrated that outflows could drive supersonic turbulence at levels consistent with the scaling relations from Matzner although with a steeper velocity power spectrum than expected for an isotropically driven supersonic turbulent cascade. Here, we perform higher resolution simulations and combine simulations of outflow driven turbulence with those of isotropically forced turbulence. We find that the presence of outflows within an ambient isotropically driven turbulent environment produces a knee in the velocity power spectrum at the outflow scale and a steeper slope at sub-outflow scales than for a purely isotropically forced case. We also find that the presence of outflows flattens the density spectrum at large scales effectively reducing the formation of large-scale turbulent density structures. These effects are qualitatively independent of resolution. We have also carried out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for synthetic data from our simulations. We find that PCA as a tool for identifying the driving scale of turbulence has a misleading bias toward low amplitude large-scale velocity structures even when they are not necessarily the dominant energy containing scales. This bias is absent for isotropically forced turbulence but manifests strongly for collimated outflow driven turbulence.},

	Abstract = {In this review we focus on the role jets and outflows play in the star- and planet-formation process. Our essential question can be posed as follows:  Are jets/outflows merely an epiphenomenon associated with star formation, or do they play an important role in mediating the physics of assembling stars both individually and globally? We address this question by reviewing the current state of observations and their key points of contact with theory. Our review of jet/outflow phenomena is organized into three length-scale domains:  (1) source and disk scales (0.1-102 AU) where the connection with protostellar and disk evolution theories is paramount; (2) envelope scales (102-105 AU) where the chemistry and propagation shed further light on the jet launching process, its variability and its impact on the infalling envelope; and (3) parent cloud scales (105-106 AU) where global momentum injection into cluster/cloud environments become relevant. Issues of feedback are of particular importance on the smallest scales, where planet formation regions in a disk may be impacted by the presence of disk winds, irradiation by jet shocks, or shielding by the winds. Feedback on envelope scales may determine the final stellar mass (core-to-star efficiency) and envelope dissipation. Feedback also plays an important role on the larger scales with outflows contributing to turbulent support within clusters, including alteration of cluster star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) (feedback on larger scales currently appears unlikely). In describing these observations we also look to the future and consider the questions that new facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Jansky Array can address. A particularly novel dimension of our review is that we consider results on jet dynamics from the emerging field of high-energy-density laboratory astrophysics (HEDLA), which is now providing direct insights into the three-dimesional dynamics of fully magnetized, hypersonic, radiative outflows.},

	Abstract = {We investigate how the removal of interstellar material by stellar feedback limits the efficiency of star formation in molecular clouds and how this determines the shape of the mass function of young star clusters. In particular, we derive relations between the power-law exponents of the mass functions of the clouds and clusters in the limiting regimes in which the feedback is energy driven and momentum driven, corresponding to minimum and maximum radiative losses, and likely to bracket all realistic cases. We find good agreement between the predicted and observed exponents, especially for momentum-driven feedback, provided the protoclusters have roughly constant mean surface density, as indicated by observations of the star-forming clumps within molecular clouds. We also consider a variety of specific feedback mechanisms, concluding that H II regions inflated by radiation pressure predominate in massive protoclusters, a momentum-limited process when photons can escape after only a few interactions with dust grains. We show in this case that the star formation efficiency depends on the masses and sizes of the protoclusters only through their mean surface density, thus ensuring consistency between the observed exponents of the mass functions of the clouds and clusters. Our numerical estimate of this efficiency is also consistent with observations.},

The data were compared with J = 1-0 of the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O data taken with the Nagoya 4 m telescope and the NANTEN telescope at the same angular resolution to derive the spatial distributions of the physical properties of the molecular gas. We explore the large velocity gradient formalism to determine the gas density and temperature using line combinations of 12CO(J = 2-1), 13CO(J = 2-1), and 13CO(J = 1-0) assuming a uniform velocity gradient and abundance ratio of CO. The derived gas density is in the range of 500 to 5000 cm-3, and the derived gas temperature is mostly in the range of 20 to 50 K along the cloud ridge with a temperature gradient depending on the distance from the star forming region. We found that the high-temperature region at the cloud edge faces the H II region, indicating that the molecular gas is interacting with the stellar wind and radiation from the massive stars. In addition, we compared the derived gas properties with the young stellar objects distribution obtained with the Spitzer telescope to investigate the relationship between the gas properties and the star formation activity therein. We found that the gas density and star formation efficiency are positively well correlated, indicating that stars form effectively in the dense gas region.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of a 4.25 deg2 area toward the North American and Pelican Nebulae in the J = 1-0 transitions of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O. Three molecules show different emission areas with their own distinct structures. These different density tracers reveal several dense clouds with a surface density of over 500 M &sun; pc-2 and a mean H2 column density of 5.8, 3.4, and 11.9 × 1021 cm-2 for 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, respectively. We obtain a total mass of 5.4 × 104 M &sun; (12CO), 2.0 × 104 M &sun; (13CO), and 6.1 × 103 M &sun; (C18O) in the complex. The distribution of excitation temperature shows two phases of gas: cold gas (~10 K) spreads across the whole cloud; warm gas (>20 K) outlines the edge of the cloud heated by the W80 H II region. The kinetic structure of the cloud indicates an expanding shell surrounding the ionized gas produced by the H II region. There are six discernible regions in the cloud: the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Islands and Sea, and Pelican's Beak, Hat, and Neck. The areas of 13CO emission range within 2-10 pc2 with mass of (1-5) × 103 M &sun; and line width of a few km s-1. The different line properties and signs of star-forming activity indicate they are in different evolutionary stages. Four filamentary structures with complicated velocity features are detected along the dark lane in LDN 935. Furthermore, a total of 611 molecular clumps within the 13CO tracing cloud are identified using the ClumpFind algorithm. The properties of the clumps suggest that most of the clumps are gravitationally bound and at an early stage of evolution with cold and dense molecular gas.},

The 1.1 mm data were taken with the AzTEC camera mounted on the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10 m telescope in Chile, and the 12CO (J = 1-0) data were with the 25 beam receiver (BEARS) on the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) 45 m telescope in the On-The-Fly (OTF) mode. The present AzTEC observations are the widest (1$\,^{\circ}$.7 × 2$\,^{\circ}$.3, corresponding to 12 pc × 17 pc) and the highest-sensitivity (˜9 mJy beam-1) 1.1 mm dust-continuum imaging of the Orion-A GMC with an effective spatial resolution of ˜40''. The 12CO (J = 1-0) image was taken over the northern 1$\,^{\circ}$.2 × 1$\,^{\circ}$.2 (corresponding 9 pc × 9 pc) area with a sensitivity of 0.93 K in TMB, a velocity resolution of 1.0 km s-1, and an effective spatial resolution of 21''. With these data, together with the MSX 8µm, Spitzer 24µm, and the 2MASS data, we have investigated the detailed structure and kinematics of molecular gas associated with the Orion-A GMC, and have found evidence for interactions between molecular clouds and the external forces that may trigger star formation. Two types of possible triggers were revealed: (1) Collisions of the diffuse gas on the cloud surface, particularly at the eastern side of the OMC-2/3 region, and (2) Irradiation of UV on the pre-existing filaments and dense molecular cloud cores. Our wide-field and high-sensitivity imaging has provided the first comprehensive view of the potential sites of triggered star formation in the Orion-A GMC.},

	Abstract = {The Gould Belt Legacy Survey will map star-forming regions within 500 pc, using Heterodyne Array Receiver Programme (HARP), Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) and Polarimeter 2 (POL-2) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). This paper describes HARP observations of the J= 3 --> 2 transitions of 13CO and C18O towards Orion A. The 15 arcsec resolution observations cover 5 pc of the Orion filament, including OMC 1 (including BN-KL and Orion bar), OMC 2/3 and OMC 4, and allow a comparative study of the molecular gas properties throughout the star-forming cloud. The filament shows a velocity gradient of ˜1 km s-1 pc-1 between OMC 1, 2 and 3, and high-velocity emission is detected in both isotopologues. The Orion Nebula and Bar have the largest masses and linewidths, and dominate the mass and energetics of the high-velocity material. Compact, spatially resolved emission from CH3CN, 13CH3OH, SO, HCOOCH3, CH3CHO and CH3OCHO is detected towards the Orion Hot Core. The cloud is warm, with a median excitation temperature of ˜24 K; the Orion Bar has the highest excitation temperature gas, at >80 K. The C18O excitation temperature correlates well with the dust temperature (to within 40 per cent). The C18O emission is optically thin, and the 13CO emission is marginally optically thick; despite its high mass, OMC 1 shows the lowest opacities. A virial analysis indicates that Orion A is too massive for thermal or turbulent support, but is consistent with a model of a filamentary cloud that is threaded by helical magnetic fields. The variation of physical conditions across the cloud is reflected in the physical characteristics of the dust cores. We find similar core properties between starless and protostellar cores, but variations in core properties with position in the filament. The OMC 1 cores have the highest velocity dispersions and masses, followed by OMC 2/3 and OMC 4. The differing fragmentation of these cores may explain why OMC 1 has formed clusters of high-mass stars, whereas OMC 4 produces fewer, predominantly low-mass stars.},

	Abstract = {Star formation is inefficient. Only a few per cent of the available gas in molecular clouds forms stars, leading to the observed low star formation rate (SFR). The same holds when averaged over many molecular clouds, such that the SFR of whole galaxies is again surprisingly low. Indeed, considering the low temperatures, molecular clouds should be highly gravitationally unstable and collapse on their global mean freefall time-scale. And yet, they are observed to live about 10-100 times longer, i.e. the SFR per freefall time (SFRff) is only a few per cent. Thus, other physical mechanisms must counteract the quick global collapse. Turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback have been proposed as regulating agents, but it is still unclear which of these processes is the most important and what their relative contributions are. Here, we run high-resolution simulations including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields and jet/outflow feedback. We confirm that clouds collapse on a mean freefall time, if only gravity is considered, producing stars at an unrealistic rate. In contrast, if turbulence, magnetic fields and feedback are included step-by-step, the SFR is reduced by a factor of 2-3 with each additional physical ingredient. When they all act in concert, we find a constant SFRff = 0.04, currently the closest match to observations, but still about a factor of 2-4 higher than the average. A detailed comparison with other simulations and with observations leads us to conclude that only models with turbulence producing large virial parameters, and including magnetic fields and feedback can produce realistic SFRs.},

@article{MacLachlan15,
	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the effects of ionising photons on accretion and stellar mass growth in a young star forming region, using a Monte Carlo radiation transfer code coupled to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation.  Methods: We introduce the framework with which we correct stellar cluster masses for the effects of photoionising (PI) feedback and compare to the results of a full ionisation hydrodynamics code.  Results: We present results of our simulations of star formation in the spiral arm of a disk galaxy, including the effects of photoionising radiation from high mass stars. We find that PI feedback reduces the total mass accreted onto stellar clusters by ≈23% over the course of the simulation and reduces the number of high mass clusters, as well as the maximum mass attained by a stellar cluster. Mean star formation rates (SFRs) drop from SFRcontrol = 4.2 × 10-2 M&sun; yr-1 to SFRMCPI = 3.2 × 10-2 M&sun; yr-1 after the inclusion of PI feedback with a final instantaneous SFR reduction of 62%. The overall cluster mass distribution appears to be affected little by PI feedback.  Conclusions: We compare our results to the observed extra-galactic Schmidt-Kennicutt relation and the observed properties of local star forming regions in the Milky Way and find that internal photoionising (PI) feedback is unlikely to reduce SFRs by more than a factor of ≈2 and thus may play only a minor role in regulating star formation.},

@article{Smith14,
	Abstract = {Our understanding of massive star evolution is in flux due to recent upheavals in our view of mass loss and observations of a high binary fraction among O-type stars. Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are lower by a factor of 2-3 compared with rates adopted in modern stellar evolution codes, due to the influence of clumping on observed diagnostics. Weaker hot star winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal to the winds, pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just a few years earlier. These eruptions are a prelude to core collapse, and may signify severe instabilities in the latest nuclear burning phases. We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of single-star evolution models. Moreover, the influence of winds and rotation has been evaluated by testing single-star models against observed statistics that, it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary evolution. Altogether, this may alter our view about the most basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss---are Wolf-Rayet stars and Type Ibc supernovae the products of winds, or are they mostly the result of binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This is not fully settled, but mounting evidence points toward the latter. This paradigm shift impacts other areas of astronomy, because it changes predictions for ionizing radiation and wind feedback from stellar populations, it may alter conclusions about star-formation rates and initial mass functions, it affects the origin of compact stellar remnants, and it influences how we use supernovae as probes of stellar evolution across cosmic time.},

@article{Vink01,
	Abstract = {We have calculated a grid of massive star wind models and mass-loss rates for a wide range of metal abundances between 1/100 <= Z/Zsun <= 10. The calculation of this grid completes the Vink et al. (2000) mass-loss recipe with an additional parameter Z. We have found that the exponent of the power law dependence of mass loss vs. metallicity is constant in the range between 1/30 <= Z/Zsun <= 3. The mass-loss rate scales as dot M ~ Z0.85 vinfty p with p = -1.23 for stars with T_eff >~ 25 000 K, and p = -1.60 for the B supergiants with T_eff <~ 25 000 K. Taking also into account the metallicity dependence of vinfty , using the power law dependence vinfty  ~ Z0.13 from Leitherer et al. (1992), the overall result of mass loss as a function of metallicity can be represented by dot M ~ Z0.69 for stars with T_eff >~ 25 000 K, and dot M ~ Z0.64 for B supergiants with T_eff <~ 25 000 K. Although it is derived that the exponent of the mass loss vs. metallicity dependence is constant over a large range in Z, one should be aware of the presence of bi-stability jumps at specific temperatures. Here the character of the line driving changes drastically due to recombinations of dominant metal species resulting in jumps in the mass loss. We have investigated the physical origins of these jumps and have derived formulae that combine mass loss recipes for both sides of such jumps. As observations of different galaxies show that the ratio Fe/O varies with metallicity, we make a distinction between the metal abundance Z derived on the basis of iron or oxygen lines. Our mass-loss predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss rates for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe that our predictions are reliable and suggest that our mass-loss recipe be used in future evolutionary calculations of massive stars at different metal abundance. A computer routine to calculate mass loss is publicly available.},

Another 86 sources previously unclassified at either optical or infrared wavelengths exhibit radio properties that are consistent with those of young stars. The overall properties of our sources at radio wavelengths such as their variability and radio to X-ray luminosity relation are consistent with previous results from the Gould's Belt Survey. Our detections provide target lists for follow-up Very Long Baseline Array radio observations to determine their distances as YSOs are located in regions of high nebulosity and extinction, making it difficult to measure optical parallaxes.},

	Abstract = {Protostellar jets and outflows are signatures of star formation and promising mechanisms for driving supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds. We quantify outflow-driven turbulence through three-dimensional numerical simulations using an isothermal version of the robust total variation diminishing code. We drive turbulence in real space using a simplified spherical outflow model, analyse the data through density probability distribution functions (PDFs), and investigate the core formation rate per free-fall time (CFRff). The real-space turbulence-driving method produces a negatively skewed density PDF possessing an enhanced tail on the low-density side. It deviates from the log-normal distributions typically obtained from Fourier-space turbulence driving at low densities, but can provide a good fit at high densities, particularly in terms of mass-weighted rather than volume-weighted density PDF. Due to this fact, we suggest that the CFRff determined from a Fourier-driven turbulence model could be comparable to that of our particular real-space-driving model, which has a ratio of solenoidal to compressional components from the resulting turbulence velocity fields of ˜0.6.},

	Abstract = {A model is proposed which can account for the longevity, energetics, and dynamical structure of dark molecular clouds. Recent observations of a high space density of T Tauri stars in some dark clouds provide the basis for the assertion that high-velocity winds from these low mass pre-main-sequence stars provide a continuous dynamic input into molecular clouds. It is postulated that as clumps are driven above the Jeans mass, both by coalescence and the enhancement of ram pressure through continuing acceleration by protostellar winds, collapse is followed by the formation of low-mass stars that generate additional protostellar winds. Finally, it is found that star formation occurs on a relatively slow time scale, comparable to the cloud lifetime},

	Abstract = {Recent numerical studies have focused their interest on the impact outflows have on the cloud's turbulence. The contradictory results obtained by these studies indicate that it is essential for observers to provide the required data to constrain the models. Here we discuss the impact of outflows on the environment surrounding clusters of young stellar objects, from an observer's point of view. We have conducted several studies of outflows in different active star-forming regions. In all cases it is clear that outflows have the power to sustain the observed turbulence in the gas surrounding protostellar clusters. We investigate whether there is a correlation between outflow strength and star formation efficiency, as predicted by numerical simulations, for six different regions in the Perseus molecular cloud complex. We argue that results of other recent studies that use CO line maps to study the turbulence driving length should not be used to discard outflows as major drivers of turbulence in clusters.},

@article{Bally06,
	Abstract = {We present new images and proper-motion measurements of irradiated outflows from young stars in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The images reveal many new outflows and new details in previously detected flows. The large-scale bipolar flows such as HH 502, 505, 874, and 876 contain multiple shocks whose velocities systematically decrease with increasing distance from their sources as the flows bend away from the core of the Orion Nebula. We consider several mechanisms for bending jets, including radiation pressure, the rocket effect on a neutral jet, and the impact of a side wind. While mild bends may be explained by either radiation pressure or the rocket effect, the extreme bends of some Orion jets and LL Ori-type bow shocks are best explained by the interaction of these outflows with a large-scale flow from the nebular core. The jet Halpha emission measures and geometry are used to estimate their mass-loss rates, which range from about M˙~10-9 to 10-6 Msolar yr-1. Many of the quasi-parabolic bow shocks that wrap around young stars in Orion (the LL Ori-type objects) exhibit large gaps between the observed jets and the parabolic fronts facing the core of the nebula. These may indicate the additional action of a wide-angle outflow component such as a T Tauri stellar wind, a proplyd photoablation flow, or possibly a photoablation flow from the jet itself. The Halpha surface brightness and radii of the LL Ori fronts are used to estimate that the M˙Vw products of the wide-angle flow components have values around 10-6 Msolar yr-1 km s-1. The side-wind density and velocity are also constrained. Outside the nebular core, the greatest concentration of bent jets and LL Ori-type parabolic fronts is located south and west of the Trapezium. The nonuniform, clumpy spatial distribution of jets, outflow sources, and proplyds in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula indicate that star formation occurred in small hierarchical clusters.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

@article{Bontemps96,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of outflow activity in a sample of 45 low-luminosity embedded young stellar objects (YSOs). We use maps in the J=2-1 line of ^12^CO to characterize this activity for YSOs that are still sufficiently embedded to show molecular outflows. Our CO outflow survey benefits from coordinated millimeter continuum measurements of circumstellar masses which allow us to estimate the evolutionary states of the central driving sources. Our sample comprises 36 near-IR (Class I) protostars and 9 far-IR/submm (Class 0) protostars, and should be representative of the ``self-embedded'' phase of (low-mass) protostellar evolution characterizing young stars still surrounded by significant circumstellar envelopes. We find that virtually all the objects in our sample have detectable CO outflow activity. We make homogeneous estimates of the outflow momentum flux deposited in the close environment of the driving sources in order to assess the dynamical properties of the underlying driving winds/jets. As is well-known, a tight correlation between outflow energetics and driving source luminosity is found for Class I sources. However, Class 0 sources lie a factor of ~10 above this correlation, suggesting they have qualitatively different (e.g., more powerful) CO outflows. In addition, we find that the outflow momentum flux correlates well with the circumstellar envelope mass of the exciting source for both Class I and Class 0 sources. We show that this new correlation is independent of the F_CO_-L_bol_ correlation and most likely results from a more or less continuous decrease of outflow power with time during the accretion phase. For a young star of final mass ~0.6Msun_, the outflow momentum flux is typically F_CO_~10^-4^Msun_.km/s/yr at the early Class 0 stage and F_CO_~2x10^-6^Msun_.km/s/yr at the late Class I stage. We suggest that this decrease of outflow energetics reflects a corresponding decay in the mass accretion/infall rate.},

@article{Mac-Low99,
	Abstract = {Molecular clouds have broad line widths, which suggests turbulent supersonic motions in the clouds. These motions are usually invoked to explain why molecular clouds take much longer than a free-fall time to form stars. Classically, it was thought that supersonic hydrodynamical turbulence would dissipate its energy quickly but that the introduction of strong magnetic fields could maintain these motions. A previous paper has shown, however, that isothermal, compressible MHD and hydrodynamical turbulence decay at virtually the same rate, requiring that constant driving occur to maintain the observed turbulence. In this paper, direct numerical computations of uniform, randomly driven turbulence with the ZEUS astrophysical MHD code are used to derive the value of the energy-dissipation coefficient, which is found to be \Edotkin~=-etavmk˜v3rms , with etav=0.21/pi, where vrms is the root-mean-square (rms) velocity in the region, Ekin is the total kinetic energy in the region, m is the mass of the region, and k˜ is the driving wavenumber. The ratio tau of the formal decay time Ekin/\Edotkin of turbulence to the free-fall time of the gas can then be shown to betau(kappa)=kappa/(Mrms)1/(4pietav) , where Mrms is the rms Mach number, and kappa is the ratio of the driving wavelength to the Jeans wavelength. It is likely that kappa<1 is required for turbulence to support gas against gravitational collapse, so the decay time will probably always be far less than the free-fall time in molecular clouds, again showing that turbulence there must be constantly and strongly driven. Finally, the typical decay time constant of the turbulence can be shown to bet0~=1.0 \Lscr/vrms , where \Lscr is the driving wavelength.},

The rate of energy injection by newly formed stars is estimated, and the effect of this energy injection on the size of the cloud is determined. It is shown that the observed rate of star formation appears adequate to support the observed clouds against gravitational collapse. The rate of photoionization-regulated star formation is estimated and it is shown to be in agreement with estimates of the observed rate of star formation if the observed molecular cloud parameters are used. The mean cloud extinction and the Galactic star formation rate per unit mass of molecular gas are predicted theoretically from the condition that photionization-regulated star formation be in equilibrium.

	Abstract = {Outflows from young stellar objects (YSOs) have been identified as a possible source of turbulence in molecular clouds. To investigate the relationship between outflows, cloud dynamics, and turbulence, we compare the kinematics of the molecular gas associated with NGC 1333, traced in 13CO (1-0), with the distribution of YSOs within. We find a velocity dispersion of ~1-1.6 km s-1 in 13CO that does not significantly vary across the cloud and is uncorrelated with the number of nearby young stellar outflows identified from optical and submillimeter observations. However, from velocity channel maps we identify about 20 depressions in the 13CO intensity of scales >~0.1-0.2 pc and velocity widths 1-3 km s-1. The depressions exhibit limb-brightened rims in both individual velocity channel maps and position-velocity diagrams, suggesting that they are slowly expanding cavities. We interpret these depressions to be remnants of past YSO outflow activity: if these cavities are presently empty, they would fill in on timescales of ~106 yr. This can exceed the lifetime of a YSO outflow phase or the transit time of the central star through the cavity, explaining the absence of any clear correlation between the cavities and YSO outflows. We find that the momentum and energy deposition associated with the expansion of the cavities is sufficient to power the turbulence in the cloud. In this way we conclude that the cavities are an important intermediate step between the conversion of YSO outflow energy and momentum into cloud turbulent motions.},

@article{Mac-Low04,
	Abstract = {Understanding the formation of stars in galaxies is central to much of modern astrophysics. However, a quantitative prediction of the star formation rate and the initial distribution of stellar masses remains elusive. For several decades it has been thought that the star formation process is primarily controlled by the interplay between gravity and magnetostatic support, modulated by neutral-ion drift (known as ambipolar diffusion in astrophysics). Recently, however, both observational and numerical work has begun to suggest that supersonic turbulent flows rather than static magnetic fields control star formation. To some extent, this represents a return to ideas popular before the importance of magnetic fields to the interstellar gas was fully appreciated. This review gives a historical overview of the successes and problems of both the classical dynamical theory and the standard theory of magnetostatic support, from both observational and theoretical perspectives. The outline of a new theory relying on control by driven supersonic turbulence is then presented. Numerical models demonstrate that, although supersonic turbulence can provide global support, it nevertheless produces density enhancements that allow local collapse. Inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support, while efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence. The consequences of this theory are then explored for both local star formation and galactic-scale star formation. It suggests that individual star-forming cores are likely not quasistatic objects, but dynamically collapsing. Accretion onto these objects varies depending on the properties of the surrounding turbulent flow; numerical models agree with observations showing decreasing rates. The initial mass distribution of stars may also be determined by the turbulent flow. Molecular clouds appear to be transient objects forming and dissolving in the larger-scale turbulent flow, or else quickly collapsing into regions of violent star formation. Global star formation in galaxies appears to be controlled by the same balance between gravity and turbulence as small-scale star formation, although modulated by cooling and differential rotation. The dominant driving mechanism in star-forming regions of galaxies appears to be supernovae, while elsewhere coupling of rotation to the gas through magnetic fields or gravity may be important.},

@article{McKee07,
	Abstract = {We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation---turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity---are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

@article{Molina12,
	Abstract = {It is widely accepted that supersonic, magnetised turbulence plays a fundamental role for star formation in molecular clouds. It produces the initial dense gas seeds out of which new stars can form. However, the exact relation between gas compression, turbulent Mach number, and magnetic field strength is still poorly understood. Here, we introduce and test an analytical prediction for the relation between the density variance and the root-mean-square Mach number in supersonic, isothermal, magnetised turbulent flows. We approximate the density and velocity structure of the interstellar medium as a superposition of shock waves. We obtain the density contrast considering the momentum equation for a single magnetised shock and extrapolate this result to the entire cloud. Depending on the field geometry, we then make three different assumptions based on observational and theoretical constraints: B independent of density, B proportional to the root square of the density and B proportional to the density. We test the analytically derived density variance--Mach number relation with numerical simulations, and find that for B proportional to the root square of the density, the variance in the logarithmic density contrast, $\sigma_{\ln \rho/\rho_0}^2=\ln[1+b^2\mathscr{M}^2\beta_0/(\beta_0+1)]$, fits very well to simulated data with turbulent forcing parameter b=0.4, when the gas is super-Alfv\'enic. However, this result breaks down when the turbulence becomes trans-Alfv\'enic or sub-Alfv\'enic, because in this regime the turbulence becomes highly anisotropic. Our density variance--Mach number relations simplify to the purely hydrodynamic relation as the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure $\beta_0$ approaches infinite.},

@article{Ballesteros-Paredes07,
	Abstract = {We review the properties of turbulent molecular clouds (MCs), focusing on the physical processes that influence star formation (SF). Molecular cloud formation appears to occur during large-scale compression of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) driven by supernovae, magnetorotational instability, or gravitational instability in galactic disks of stars and gas. The compressions generate turbulence that can accelerate molecule production and produce the observed morphology. We then review the properties of MC turbulence, including density enhancements observed as clumps and cores, magnetic field structure, driving scales, the relation to observed scaling relations, and the interaction with gas thermodynamics. We argue that MC cores are dynamical, not quasistatic, objects with relatively short lifetimes not exceeding a few megayears. We review their morphology, magnetic fields, density and velocity profiles, and virial budget. Next, we discuss how MC turbulence controls SF. On global scales turbulence prevents monolithic collapse of the clouds; on small scales it promotes local collapse. We discuss its effects on the SF efficiency, and critically examine the possible relation between the clump mass distribution and the initial mass function, and then turn to the redistribution of angular momentum during collapse and how it determines the multiplicity of stellar systems. Finally, we discuss the importance of dynamical interactions between protostars in dense clusters, and the effect of the ionization and winds from those protostars on the surrounding cloud. We conclude that the interaction of self-gravity and turbulence controls MC formation and behavior, as well as the core- and star-formation processes within them.},

@article{Brunt10,
	Abstract = {Supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds is a key agent in generating density enhancements that may subsequently go on to form stars. The stronger the turbulence - the higher the Mach number - the more extreme the density fluctuations are expected to be. Numerical models predict an increase in density variance, sigma2rho/rho0, with rms Mach number, M of the form: sigma2rho/rho0 = b2M2, where b is a numerically-estimated parameter, and this prediction forms the basis of a large number of analytic models of star formation. We provide an estimate of the parameter b from 13CO J = 1-0 spectral line imaging observations and extinction mapping of the Taurus molecular cloud, using a recently developed technique that needs information contained solely in the projected column density field to calculate sigma2rho/rho0. When this is combined with a measurement of the rms Mach number, M, we are able to estimate b. We find b = 0.48+0.15-0.11, which is consistent with typical numerical estimates, and is characteristic of turbulent driving that includes a mixture of solenoidal and compressive modes. More conservatively, we constrain b to lie in the range 0.3-0.8, depending on the influence of sub-resolution structure and the role of diffuse atomic material in the column density budget (accounting for sub-resolution variance results in higher values of b, while inclusion of more low column density material results in lower values of b; the value b = 0.48 applies to material which is predominantly molecular, with no correction for sub-resolution variance). We also report a break in the Taurus column density power spectrum at a scale of ~1 pc, and find that the break is associated with anisotropy in the power spectrum. The break is observed in both 13CO and dust extinction power spectra, which, remarkably, are effectively identical despite detailed spatial differences between the 13CO and dust extinction maps.},

	Abstract = {Complex organic molecules are ubiquitous companions of young low-mass protostars. Recent observations suggest that their emission stems, not only from the traditional hot corino, but also from offset positions. In this work, 2D physicochemical modelling of an envelope-cavity system is carried out. Wavelength-dependent radiative transfer calculations are performed and a comprehensive gas-grain chemical network is used to simulate the physical and chemical structure. The morphology of the system delineates three distinct regions: the cavity wall layer with time-dependent and species-variant enhancements; a torus rich in complex organic ices, but not reflected in gas-phase abundances; and the remaining outer envelope abundant in simpler solid and gaseous molecules. Strongly irradiated regions, such as the cavity wall layer, are subject to frequent photodissociation in the solid phase. Subsequent recombination of the photoproducts leads to frequent reactive desorption, causing gas-phase enhancements of several orders of magnitude. This mechanism remains to be quantified with laboratory experiments. Direct photodesorption is found to be relatively inefficient. If radicals are not produced directly in the icy mantle, the formation of complex organics is impeded. For efficiency, a sufficient number of FUV photons needs to penetrate the envelope; and elevated cool dust temperatures need to enable grain-surface radical mobility. As a result, a high stellar luminosity and a sufficiently wide cavity favor chemical complexity. Furthermore within this paradigm, complex organics are demonstrated to have unique lifetimes and be grouped into early (formaldehyde, ketene, methanol, formic acid, methyl formate, acetic acid, glycolaldehyde) and late (acetaldehyde, dimethyl ether, ethanol) species.},

	Abstract = {We study the observable signatures of self-gravitating MHD turbulence by applying the probability density functions (PDFs) and the spatial density power spectrum to synthetic column density maps. We find that there exists three characterizable stages of the evolution of the collapsing cloud which we term "early," "intermediate," and "advanced." At early times, i.e. $t<0.15t_{ff}$, the column density has a power spectral slope similar to nongravitating supersonic turbulence and a lognormal distribution. At an intermediate stage, i.e. $0.15t_{ff}< t \leq 0.35t_{ff}$, there exists signatures of the prestellar cores in the shallower PDF and power spectrum power law slopes. The column density PDF power law tails at these times have line of sight averaged slopes ranging from -2.5 to -1.5 with shallower values belonging to simulations with lower magnetic field strength. The density power spectrum slope becomes shallow and can be characterized by $P(k)=A_1k^{\beta_2}e^{-k/k_c}$, where $A_1$ describes the amplitude, $k^{\beta_2}$ describes the classical power law behavior and the scale $k_c$ characterizes the turn over from turbulence dominated to self-gravity dominated. At advanced stages of collapse, i.e. $\approx t>0.35t_{ff}$, the power spectral slope is positive valued, and a dramatic increase is observed in the PDF moments and the Tsallis incremental PDF parameters, which gives rise to deviations between PDF-sonic Mach number relations. Finally, we show that the imprint of gravity on the density power spectrum can be replicated in non-gravitating turbulence by introducing a delta-function with amplitude equivalent to the maximum valued point in a given self-gravitating map. We find that the turbulence power spectrum restored through spatial filtering of the high density material.},

@article{Salim15,
	Abstract = {Whilst the star formation rate (SFR) of molecular clouds and galaxies is key in understanding galaxy evolution, the physical processes which determine the SFR remain unclear. This uncertainty about the underlying physics has resulted in various different star formation laws, all having substantial intrinsic scatter. Extending upon previous works that define the column density of star formation (Sigma_SFR) by the gas column density (Sigma_gas), we develop a new universal star formation (SF) law based on the multi-freefall prescription of gas. This new SF law relies predominantly on the probability density function (PDF) and on the sonic Mach number of the turbulence in the star-forming clouds. By doing so we derive a relation where the star formation rate (SFR) correlates with the molecular gas mass per multi-freefall time, whereas previous models had used the average, single-freefall time. We define a new quantity called maximum (multi-freefall) gas consumption rate (MGCR) and show that the actual SFR is only about 0.4% of this maximum possible SFR, confirming the observed low efficiency of star formation. We show that placing observations in this new framework (Sigma_SFR vs. MGCR) yields a significantly improved correlation with 3-4 times reduced scatter compared to previous SF laws and a goodness-of-fit parameter R^2=0.97. By inverting our new relationship, we provide sonic Mach number predictions for kpc-scale observations of Local Group galaxies as well as unresolved observations of local and high-redshift disk and starburst galaxies that do not have independent, reliable estimates for the turbulent cloud Mach number.},

@article{Voit15,
	Abstract = {Galaxy growth depends critically on the interplay between radiative cooling of cosmic gas and the resulting energetic feedback that cooling triggers. This interplay has proven exceedingly difficult to model, even with large supercomputer simulations, because of its complexity. Nevertheless, real galaxies are observed to obey simple scaling relations among their primary observable characteristics. Here we show that a generic emergent property of the interplay between cooling and feedback can explain the observed scaling relationships between a galaxy's stellar mass, its total mass, and its chemical enrichment level, as well as the relationship between the average orbital velocity of its stars and the mass of its central black hole. These relationships naturally result from any feedback mechanism that strongly heats a galaxy's circumgalactic gas in response to precipitation of colder clouds out of that gas, because feedback then suspends the gas in a marginally precipitating state.},

@article{Ansdell15,
	Abstract = {We present results from an 850-$\mu$m survey of the $\sim$ 5 Myr old $\lambda$ Orionis star-forming region. We used the SCUBA-2 camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope to survey a $\sim$0.5-diameter circular region containing 36 (out of 59) cluster members with infrared excesses indicative of circumstellar disks. We detected only one object at $>3\sigma$ significance, the Herbig Ae star HD 245185, with a flux density of $\sim74$ mJy beam$^{-1}$ corresponding to a dust mass of $\sim150$ M$_{\oplus}$. Stacking the individually undetected sources did not produce a significant mean signal but gives an upper limit on the average dust mass for $\lambda$ Orionis disks of $\sim3$ M$_{\oplus}$. Our follow-up observations of HD 245185 with the Submillimeter Array found weak CO 2--1 line emission with an integrated flux of $\sim170$ mJy km s$^{-1}$ but no $^{13}$CO or C$^{18}$O isotopologue emission at 30 mJy km s$^{-1}$ sensitivity, suggesting a gas mass of $\lesssim1$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. The implied gas-to-dust ratio is thus $\gtrsim50$ times lower than the canonical interstellar medium value, setting HD 245185 apart from other Herbig Ae disks of similar age, which have been found to be gas rich; as HD 245185 also shows signs of accretion, we may be catching it in the final phases of disk clearing. Our study of the $\lambda$ Orionis cluster places quantitative constraints on planet formation timescales, indicating that at $\sim5$ Myr the average disk no longer has sufficient dust and gas to form giant planets and perhaps even super Earths; the bulk material has been mostly dispersed or is locked in pebbles/planetesimals larger than a few mm in size.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the impact of high optical depth on the HI surface density (Sigma_HI) saturation observed in the Perseus molecular cloud. We use Arecibo HI emission and absorption measurements obtained toward 26 radio continuum sources to derive the spin temperature and optical depth of individual HI components along each line of sight. The derived properties are used to estimate the correction for high optical depth. We examine two different methods for the correction, Gaussian decomposition and isothermal approximation methods, and find that they are consistent as having the maximum correction factor of ~1.2 likely due to the relatively low optical depth and insignificant contribution from the diffuse radio continuum emission for Perseus. We apply the correction to the HI column density image derived in the optically thin approximation on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and find that the total HI mass increases by only ~10%. Using the corrected HI column density image and far-infrared data from the Improved Reprocessing of the IRAS Survey, we then derive the H2 column density across the cloud on ~0.4 pc scales. For five dark and star-forming regions in Perseus, the HI surface density is uniform with Sigma_HI ~ 7-9 solar mass/pc2, in agreement with the minimum HI surface density required for shielding H2 against photodissociation. As a result, Sigma_H2/Sigma_HI and Sigma_HI+Sigma_H2 show a remarkably tight relation. Our results are consistent with predictions for H2 formation in steady state and chemical equilibrium, and suggest that H2 formation is mainly responsible for the HI saturation in Perseus. We also compare the optically thick HI with the observed "CO-dark" gas, and find that the optically thick HI only accounts for ~20% of the "CO-dark" gas in Perseus.},

	Abstract = {We combine previously published interferometric and single-dish data of relatively nearby massive dense cores that are actively forming stars to test whether their `fragmentation level' is controlled by turbulent or thermal support. We find no clear correlation between the fragmentation level and velocity dispersion, nor between the observed number of fragments and the number of fragments expected when the gravitationally unstable mass is calculated including various prescriptions for `turbulent support'. On the other hand, the best correlations are found for the case of pure thermal Jeans fragmentation, for which we infer a core formation efficiency in the range 12-34%, consistent with previous works. We conclude that the dominant factor determining the fragmentation level of star-forming massive dense cores seems to be thermal Jeans fragmentation.},

	Abstract = {We employ the Delta-variance analysis and study the turbulent gas dynamics of simulated molecular clouds (MCs). Our models account for a simplified treatment of time-dependent chemistry and the non-isothermal nature of the gas. We investigate simulations using three different initial mean number densities of n_0 = 30, 100 and 300 cm^{-3} that span the range of values typical for MCs in the solar neighbourhood. Furthermore, we model the CO line emission in a post-processing step using a radiative transfer code. We evaluate Delta-variance spectra for centroid velocity (CV) maps as well as for integrated intensity and column density maps for various chemical components: the total, H2 and 12CO number density and the integrated intensity of both the 12CO and 13CO (J = 1 -> 0) lines. The spectral slopes of the Delta-variance computed on the CV maps for the total and H2 number density are significantly steeper compared to the different CO tracers. We find slopes for the linewidth-size relation ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 for the total and H2 density models, while the slopes for the various CO tracers range from 0.2 to 0.4 and underestimate the values for the total and H2 density by a factor of 1.5-3.0. We demonstrate that optical depth effects can significantly alter the Delta-variance spectra. Furthermore, we report a critical density threshold of ~100 cm^{-3} at which the Delta-variance slopes of the various CO tracers change sign. We thus conclude that carbon monoxide traces the total cloud structure well only if the average cloud density lies above this limit.},

@article{Faucher-Giguere13,
	Abstract = {We present a two-zone theory for feedback-regulated star formation in galactic discs, consistently connecting the galaxy-averaged star formation law with star formation proceeding in giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Our focus is on galaxies with gas surface density Sigmag ≳ 100 M&sun; pc-2, where the interstellar medium (ISM) can be assumed to be fully molecular. This regime includes most star formation in the Universe and our basic framework can be extended to other galaxies. In our theory, the galactic disc consists of Toomre-mass GMCs embedded in a volume-filling ISM. Radiation pressure on dust disperses GMCs and most supernovae explode in the volume-filling medium. A galaxy-averaged star formation law is derived by balancing the momentum input from supernova feedback with the vertical gravitational weight of the disc gas. This star formation law is in good agreement with observations for a CO conversion factor depending continuously on Sigmag. We argue that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time, ε _ff^gal, is only a weak function of the efficiency with which GMCs convert their gas into stars, ε _int^GMC. This is possible because the rate limiting step for star formation is the rate at which GMCs form: for large efficiency of star formation in GMCs, the Toomre Q parameter obtains a value slightly above unity so that the GMC formation rate is consistent with the galaxy-averaged star formation law. We contrast our results with other theories of turbulence-regulated star formation and discuss predictions of our model. Using a compilation of data from the literature, we show that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time is non-universal and increases with increasing gas fraction, as predicted by our model. We also predict that the fraction of the disc gas mass in bound GMCs decreases for increasing values of the GMC star formation efficiency. This is qualitatively consistent with the smooth molecular gas distribution inferred in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies and the small mass fraction in giant clumps in high-redshift galaxies.},

@article{Dobbs13,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in a galactic disc simulation. We follow individual GMCs (defined in our simulations by a total column density criterion), including their level of star formation, from their formation to dispersal. We find the evolution of GMCs is highly complex, and GMCs cannot be considered as isolated objects. GMCs often form from a combination of smaller clouds and ambient interstellar medium (ISM), and similarly disperse by splitting into a number of smaller clouds and ambient ISM. However some clouds emerge as the result of the disruption of a more massive GMC, rather than from the assembly of smaller clouds. Likewise in some cases, clouds accrete on to more massive clouds rather than disperse. Because of the difficulty of determining a precursor or successor of a given GMC, determining GMC histories and lifetimes is highly non-trivial. Using a definition relating to the continuous evolution of a cloud, we obtain lifetimes typically of 4-25 Myr for >105 M&sun; GMCs, over which time the star formation efficiency is about 1 per cent. We also relate the lifetime of GMCs to their crossing time. We find that the crossing time is a reasonable measure of the actual lifetime of the cloud, although there is considerable scatter. The scatter is found to be unavoidable because of the complex and varied shapes and dynamics of the clouds. We study cloud dispersal in detail and find both stellar feedback and shear contribute to cloud disruption. We also demonstrate that GMCs do not behave as ridge clouds, rather massive spiral arm GMCs evolve into smaller clouds in interarm spurs.},

@article{Vazquez-Semadeni10,
	Abstract = {We numerically investigate the effect of feedback from the ionization heating from massive stars on the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their star formation efficiency (SFE), which we treat as an instantaneous, time-dependent quantity. We follow the GMCs' evolution from their formation to advanced star-forming stages. After an initial period of contraction, the collapsing clouds begin forming stars, whose feedback evaporates part of the clouds' mass, opposing the continuing accretion from the infalling gas. Our results are as follows: (1) in the presence of feedback, the clouds attain levels of the SFE that are consistent at all times with observational determinations for regions of comparable star formation rates. (2) However, the dense gas mass is larger in general in the presence of feedback, while the total mass (dense gas + stars) is nearly insensitive to the presence of feedback, suggesting that it is determined mainly by the accretion, while the feedback inhibits mainly the conversion of dense gas to stars, because it acts directly to reheat and disperse the gas that is directly on its way to forming stars. (3) The factor by which the SFE is reduced upon the inclusion of feedback is a decreasing function of the cloud's mass, for clouds of size ~10 pc. This naturally explains the larger observed SFEs of massive-star-forming regions. (4) The clouds may attain a pseudo-virialized state, with a value of the virial mass very similar to the actual cloud mass. However, this state differs from true virialization in that the clouds, rather than being equilibrium entities, are the centers of a larger-scale collapse, in which accretion replenishes the mass consumed by star formation. (5) The higher-density regions within the clouds are in a similar situation, accreting gas infalling from the less-dense, more extended regions of the clouds. (6) The density probability density functions of the regions containing the clouds in general exhibit a shape characteristic of thermally bistable flows, and extend down to densities corresponding to the warm atomic medium, because the warm gas interpenetrates the clouds. The general picture arising from our simulations is that the gas involved in the gravitational contraction leading to star formation extends to large scales and is not confined to the local environment of the final collapse, where the effect of the feedback is active, in agreement with recent proposals of a gravitationally driven mass cascade from large to small scales.},

	Abstract = {Despite the simplicity of theoretical models of supersonically turbulent, isothermal media, their predictions successfully match the observed gas structure and star formation activity within low-pressure (P/k < 105 K cm-3) molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. However, it is unknown whether or not these theories extend to clouds in high-pressure (P/k > 107 K cm-3) environments, like those in the Galaxy's inner 200 pc central molecular zone (CMZ) and in the early universe. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 3 mm dust continuum emission within a cloud, G0.253+0.016, which is immersed in the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. While the log-normal shape and dispersion of its column density probability distribution function (PDF) are strikingly similar to those of solar neighborhood clouds, there is one important quantitative difference: its mean column density is one to two orders of magnitude higher. Both the similarity and difference in the PDF compared to those derived from solar neighborhood clouds match predictions of turbulent cloud models given the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. The PDF shows a small deviation from log-normal at high column densities confirming the youth of G0.253+0.016. Its lack of star formation is consistent with the theoretically predicted, environmentally dependent volume density threshold for star formation which is orders of magnitude higher than that derived for solar neighborhood clouds. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that the current theoretical understanding of molecular cloud structure derived from the solar neighborhood also holds in high-pressure environments. We therefore suggest that these theories may be applicable to understand star formation in the early universe.},

@article{Dutrey14,
	Abstract = {The formation of planets around binary stars may be more difficult than around single stars. In a close binary star (with a separation of less than a hundred astronomical units), theory predicts the presence of circumstellar disks around each star, and an outer circumbinary disk surrounding a gravitationally cleared inner cavity around the stars. Given that the inner disks are depleted by accretion onto the stars on timescales of a few thousand years, any replenishing material must be transferred from the outer reservoir to fuel planet formation (which occurs on timescales of about one million years). Gas flowing through disk cavities has been detected in single star systems. A circumbinary disk was discovered around the young low-mass binary system GG Tau A (ref. 7), which has recently been shown to be a hierarchical triple system. It has one large inner disk around the single star, GG Tau Aa, and shows small amounts of shocked hydrogen gas residing within the central cavity, but other than a single weak detection, the distribution of cold gas in this cavity or in any other binary or multiple star system has not hitherto been determined. Here we report imaging of gas fragments emitting radiation characteristic of carbon monoxide within the GG Tau A cavity. From the kinematics we conclude that the flow appears capable of sustaining the inner disk (around GG Tau Aa) beyond the accretion lifetime, leaving time for planet formation to occur there. These results show the complexity of planet formation around multiple stars and confirm the general picture predicted by numerical simulations.},

@article{Hirota15,
	Abstract = {We have carried out high-resolution observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) of continuum emission from the Orion Kleinmann-Low (KL) region. We identify 11 compact sources at ALMA band 6 (245 GHz) and band 7 (339 GHz), including the Hot Core, Compact Ridge, SMA1, IRc4, IRc7, and a radio source I (Source I). A spectral energy distribution (SED) of each source is determined by using previous 3 mm continuum emission data. Physical properties such as size, mass, hydrogen number density, and column density are discussed based on the dust graybody SED. Among 11 identified sources, Source I, a massive protostar candidate, is a dominant energy source in Orion KL. We extensively investigate its SED from centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. The SED of Source I can be fitted with a single power-law index of 1.97, suggesting an optically thick emission. We employ the H- free-free emission as an opacity source of this optically thick emission. The temperature, density, and mass of the circumstellar disk associated with Source I are constrained by the SED of H- free-free emission. Still, the fitting result shows a significant deviation from the observed flux densities. Combined with the thermal dust graybody SED to explain excess emission at higher frequency, a smaller power-law index of 1.60 for the H- free-free emission is obtained in the SED fitting. The power-law index smaller than two would suggest a compact source size or a clumpy structure unresolved with the present study. Future higher resolution observations with ALMA are essential to reveal more detailed spatial structure and physical properties of Source I.},

	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of protoplanetary disks ("proplyds") in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We imaged five individual fields at 856 mum containing 22 Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-identified proplyds and detected 21 of them. Eight of those disks were detected for the first time at submillimeter wavelengths, including the most prominent, well-known proplyd in the entire Orion Nebula, 114-426. Thermal dust emission in excess of any free-free component was measured in all but one of the detected disks, and ranged between 1 and 163 mJy, with resulting disk masses of 0.3-79 M jup. An additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disks in HST observations were also imaged within the 5 fields, but only 2 were detected. The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include OB stars, theta1 Ori C, and theta1 Ori F, range from 0.1 to 0.6 M jup. Combining these ALMA data with previous Submillimeter Array observations, we find a lack of massive (gsim3 M jup) disks in the extreme-UV-dominated region of Orion, within 0.03 pc of theta1 Ori C. At larger separations from theta1 Ori C, in the far-UV-dominated region, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in low-mass star forming regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a rapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation in the extreme-UV-dominated regions of OB associations, but leaves disks in the far-UV-dominated regions relatively unaffected.},

@article{Nissen12,
	Abstract = {Context. Stars whose mass is an order of magnitude greater than the Sun play a prominent role in the evolution of galaxies, exploding as supernovae, triggering bursts of star formation and spreading heavy elements about their host galaxies. A fundamental aspect of star formation is the creation of an outflow. The fast outflow emerging from a region associated with massive star formation in the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC-1), located behind the Orion Nebula, appears to have been set in motion by an explosive event.  Aims: We study the structure and dynamics of outflows in OMC-1. We combine radial velocity and proper motion data for near-IR emission of molecular hydrogen to obtain the first 3-dimensional (3D) structure of the OMC-1 outflow. Our work illustrates a new diagnostic tool for studies of star formation that will be exploited in the near future with the advent of high spatial resolution spectro-imaging in particular with data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).  Methods: We used published radial and proper motion velocities obtained from the shock-excited vibrational emission in the H2 v = 1-0 S(1) line at 2.122 mum obtained with the GriF instrument on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the Apache Point Observatory, the Anglo-Australian Observatory, and the Subaru Telescope.  Results: These data give the 3D velocity of ejecta yielding a 3D reconstruction of the outflows. This allows one to view the material from different vantage points in space giving considerable insight into the geometry. Our analysis indicates that the ejection occurred ≲720 years ago from a distorted ring-like structure of ~15" (6000 AU) in diameter centered on the proposed point of close encounter of the stars BN, source I and maybe also source n. We propose a simple model involving curvature of shock trajectories in magnetic fields through which the origin of the explosion and the center defined by extrapolated proper motions of BN, I and n may be brought into spatial coincidence.  Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

@article{Bally15,
	Abstract = {Aims. Adaptive optics images are used to test the hypothesis that the explosive BN/KL outflow from the Orion OMC1 cloud core was powered by the dynamical decay of a non-hierarchical system of massive stars. Methods. Narrow-band H2, [Fe II], and broad-band Ks obtained with the Gemini South multi-conjugate adaptive optics (AO) system GeMS and near-infrared imager GSAOI are presented. The images reach resolutions of 0.08 to 0.10", close to the 0.07" diffraction limit of the 8-meter telescope at 2.12 microns. Comparison with previous AO-assisted observations of sub-fields and other ground-based observations enable measurements of proper motions and the investigation of morphological changes in H2 and [Fe II] features with unprecedented precision. The images are compared with numerical simulations of compact, high-density clumps moving ~1000 times their own diameter through a lower density medium at Mach 1000. Results. Several sub-arcsecond H2 features and many [Fe II] 'fingertips' on the projected outskirts of the flow show proper motions of ~300 km/s. High-velocity, sub-arcsecond H2 knots ('bullets') are seen as far as 140" from their suspected ejection site. If these knots propagated through the dense Orion A cloud, their survival sets a lower bound on their densities of order 10^7 cm^-3, consistent with an origin within a few au of a massive star and accelerated by a final multi-body dynamic encounter that ejected the BN object and radio source I from OMC1 about 500 years ago. Conclusions. Over 120 high-velocity bow-shocks propagating in nearly all directions from the OMC1 cloud core provide evidence for an explosive origin for the BN/KL outflow triggered by the dynamic decay of a non-hierarchical system of massive stars. Such events may be linked to the origin of runaway, massive stars.},

	Abstract = {Supernova (SN) feedback is one of the key processes shaping the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. SNe contribute to (and in some cases may dominate) driving turbulence in the ISM and accelerating galactic winds. Modern cosmological simulations have sufficient resolution to capture the main structures in the ISM of galaxies, but are typically still not capable of explicitly resolving all of the small-scale stellar feedback processes, including the expansion of supernova remnants (SNRs). We perform a series of controlled three-dimensional hydrodynamic (adaptive mesh refinement) simulations of single SNRs expanding in an inhomogeneous density field with statistics motivated by those of the turbulent ISM. We use these to quantify the momentum and thermal energy injection from SNe as a function of spatial scale and the density, metallicity, and structure of the ambient medium. We develop a series of analytic formulae that we fit to the simulations. These formulae can be used as a basis for a more predictive sub-resolution model for SN feedback for galaxy formation simulations. We then use simulations of multiple, stochastically driven SNe that resolve the key phases of SNRs to test the sub-resolution model, and show that it accurately captures the turbulent kinetic energy and thermal energy in the ISM. By contrast, proposed SN feedback models in the literature based on `delayed cooling' significantly overpredict the late-time thermal energy and momentum in SNRs.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of outflows in the star-forming region NGC 1333 using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA). We combined the 12CO and 13CO (1-0) CARMA mosaics with data from the 14 m Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory to probe the central, most dense, and active region of this protostellar cluster at scales from 5'' to 7' (or 1000 AU to 0.5 pc at a distance of 235 pc). We map and identify 12CO outflows, and along with 13CO data we estimate their mass, momentum, and energy. Within the 7' × 7' map, the 5'' resolution allows for a detailed study of morphology and kinematics of outflows and outflow candidates, some of which were previously confused with other outflow emission in the region. In total, we identify 22 outflow lobes, as well as 9 dense circumstellar envelopes marked by continuum emission, of which 6 drive outflows. We calculate a total outflow mass, momentum, and energy within the mapped region of 6 M &sun;, 19 M &sun; km s-1, and 7 × 1044 erg, respectively. Within this same region, we compare outflow kinematics with turbulence and gravitational energy, and we suggest that outflows are likely important agents for the maintenance of turbulence in this region. In the earliest stages of star formation, outflows do not yet contribute enough energy to totally disrupt the clustered region where most star formation is happening, but have the potential to do so as the protostellar sources evolve. Our results can be used to constrain outflow properties, such as outflow strength, in numerical simulations of outflow-driven turbulence in clusters.},

@article{Offner14,
	Abstract = {We investigate protostellar outflow evolution, gas entrainment, and star formation efficiency using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of isolated, turbulent low-mass cores. We adopt an X-wind launching model, in which the outflow rate is coupled to the instantaneous protostellar accretion rate and evolution. We vary the outflow collimation angle from theta = 0.01-0.1 and find that even well-collimated outflows effectively sweep up and entrain significant core mass. The Stage 0 lifetime ranges from 0.14-0.19 Myr, which is similar to the observed Class 0 lifetime. The star formation efficiency of the cores spans 0.41-0.51. In all cases, the outflows drive strong turbulence in the surrounding material. Although the initial core turbulence is purely solenoidal by construction, the simulations converge to approximate equipartition between solenoidal and compressive motions due to a combination of outflow driving and collapse. When compared to simulation of a cluster of protostars, which is not gravitationally centrally condensed, we find that the outflows drive motions that are mainly solenoidal. The final turbulent velocity dispersion is about twice the initial value of the cores, indicating that an individual outflow is easily able to replenish turbulent motions on sub-parsec scales. We post-process the simulations to produce synthetic molecular line emission maps of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O and evaluate how well these tracers reproduce the underlying mass and velocity structure.},

	Abstract = {We present high spatial resolution 12CO (J = 1-0) images taken by the Nobeyama 45 m telescope toward a 48' × 48' area, including the L1641-N cluster. The effective spatial resolution of the maps is 21'', corresponding to 0.04 pc at a distance of 400 pc. A recent 1.1 mm dust continuum map reveals that the dense gas is concentrated in several thin filaments. We find that a few dust filaments are located at the parts where 12CO (J = 1-0) emission drops sharply. Furthermore, the filaments have two components with different velocities. The velocity difference between the two components is about 3 km s-1, corresponding to a Mach number of 10, significantly larger than the local turbulent velocity in the cloud. These facts imply that the collision of the two components (hereafter, the cloud-cloud collision) possibly contributed to the formation of these filaments. Since the two components appear to overlap toward the filaments on the plane of the sky, the collision may have occurred almost along the line of sight. Star formation in the L1641-N cluster was probably triggered by such a collision. We also find several parsec-scale CO shells whose centers are close to either the L1641-N cluster or the V 380 Ori cluster. We propose that these shells were created by multiple winds and/or outflows from cluster young stellar objects, i.e., "protocluster winds." One exceptional dust filament located at the western cloud edge lies along a shell; it is presumably part of the expanding shell. Both the cloud-cloud collision and protocluster winds are likely to influence the cloud structure and kinematics in this region.},

	Abstract = {Hypervelocity stars (HVS) travel with velocities so high, that they exceed the escape velocity of the Galaxy. Several acceleration mechanisms have been discussed. Only one HVS (US 708, HVS 2) is a compact helium star. Here we present a spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of US\,708. Travelling with a velocity of $\sim1200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, it is the fastest unbound star in our Galaxy. In reconstructing its trajectory, the Galactic center becomes very unlikely as an origin, which is hardly consistent with the most favored ejection mechanism for the other HVS. Furthermore, we discovered US\,708 to be a fast rotator. According to our binary evolution model it was spun-up by tidal interaction in a close binary and is likely to be the ejected donor remnant of a thermonuclear supernova.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the formation of both clustered and distributed populations of young stars in a single molecular cloud. We present a numerical simulation of a 104  M&sun; elongated, turbulent, molecular cloud and the formation of over 2500 stars. The stars form both in stellar clusters and in a distributed mode, which is determined by the local gravitational binding of the cloud. A density gradient along the major axis of the cloud produces bound regions that form stellar clusters and unbound regions that form a more distributed population. The initial mass function (IMF) also depends on the local gravitational binding of the cloud with bound regions forming full IMFs whereas in the unbound, distributed regions the stellar masses cluster around the local Jeans mass and lack both the high-mass and the low-mass stars. The overall efficiency of star formation is ≈ 15 per cent in the cloud when the calculation is terminated, but varies from less than 1 per cent in the regions of distributed star formation to ≈ 40 per cent in regions containing large stellar clusters. Considering that large-scale surveys are likely to catch clouds at all evolutionary stages, estimates of the (time-averaged) star formation efficiency (SFE) for the giant molecular cloud reported here is only ≈ 4 per cent. This would lead to the erroneous conclusion of slow star formation when in fact it is occurring on a dynamical time-scale.},

@article{Elmegreen00,
	Abstract = {Observations suggest that star formation occurs in only one or two crossing times for a range of scales spanning a factor of ~1000. These observations include (1) measurements of embedded cluster ages in comparison with the cloud core dynamical times, (2) measurements of the age difference versus separation for clusters in the Large Magellanic Clouds in comparison with the crossing time versus size correlation for molecular clouds, (3) the hierarchical structure of embedded young clusters, and (4) the high fraction of dense clouds that contain star formation. Such a short overall timescale for star formation implies that sources of turbulent energy or internal feedback are not required to explain or extend cloud lifetimes and that star and protostar interactions cannot be important for the stellar initial mass function. Stars appear in a cloud as if they freeze out of the gas, preserving the turbulent-driven gas structure in their birth locations. The Galaxy-wide star formation rate avoids the Zuckerman-Evans catastrophe, which has long been a concern for molecular clouds that evolve this quickly, because the multifractal structure of interstellar gas ensures that only a small fraction of the mass is able to form stars. Star formation on large scales operates more slowly than on small scales, but in most cases the whole process is over in only a few dynamical times.},

@article{Gratier12,
	Abstract = {We present an analysis of a systematic CO(2-1) survey at 12'' resolution covering most of the Local Group spiral M 33, which, at a distance of 840 kpc, is close enough for individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) to be identified. The goal of this work is to study the properties of the GMCs in this subsolar metallicity galaxy. The CPROPS (Cloud PROPertieS) algorithm was used to identify 337 GMCs in M 33, the largest sample to date for an external galaxy. The sample is used to study the GMC luminosity function, or mass spectrum under the assumption of a constant N(H2) / ICO ratio. We find that n(L)dL ∝ L-2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 for the entire sample. However, when the sample is divided into inner and outer disk samples, the exponent changes from 1.6 $\pm$ 0.2 in the center 2 kpc to 2.3 $\pm$ 0.2 for galactocentric distances larger than 2 kpc. On the basis of the emission in the FUV, Halpha, 8 mum, and 24 mum bands, each cloud was classified in terms of its star-forming activity - no star formation or either embedded or exposed star formation (visible in FUV and Halpha). At least one sixth of the clouds had no (massive) star formation, suggesting that the average time required for star formation to start is about one sixth of the total time for which the object is identifiable as a GMC. The clouds without star formation have significantly lower CO luminosities than those with star formation, whether embedded or exposed, a result that is presumably related to the lack of heating sources. Taking the cloud sample as a whole, the main non-trivial correlation is the decrease in cloud CO brightness (or luminosity) with galactocentric radius. The complete cloud catalog, including the CO and HI spectra and the CO contours overlaid on the FUV, Halpha, 8 mum, and 24 mum images is presented in the appendix.

@article{Lada10,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the level of star formation activity within nearby molecular clouds. We employ a uniform set of infrared extinction maps to provide accurate assessments of cloud mass and structure and compare these with inventories of young stellar objects within the clouds. We present evidence indicating that both the yield and rate of star formation can vary considerably in local clouds, independent of their mass and size. We find that the surface density structure of such clouds appears to be important in controlling both these factors. In particular, we find that the star formation rate (SFR) in molecular clouds is linearly proportional to the cloud mass (M 0.8) above an extinction threshold of A  K ≈ 0.8 mag, corresponding to a gas surface density threshold of Sigmagas ≈ 116 M sun pc2. We argue that this surface density threshold corresponds to a gas volume density threshold which we estimate to be n(H2) ≈ 104 cm-3. Specifically, we find SFR (M sun yr-1) = 4.6 $\pm$ 2.6 × 10-8 M 0.8 (M sun) for the clouds in our sample. This relation between the rate of star formation and the amount of dense gas in molecular clouds appears to be in excellent agreement with previous observations of both galactic and extragalactic star-forming activity. It is likely the underlying physical relationship or empirical law that most directly connects star formation activity with interstellar gas over many spatial scales within and between individual galaxies. These results suggest that the key to obtaining a predictive understanding of the SFRs in molecular clouds and galaxies is to understand those physical factors which give rise to the dense components of these clouds.},

	Abstract = {The most recent observational evidence seems to indicate that giant molecular clouds are predominantly gravitationally unbound objects. In this paper we show that this is a natural consequence of a scenario in which cloud-cloud collisions and stellar feedback regulate the internal velocity dispersion of the gas, and so prevent global gravitational forces from becoming dominant. Thus, whilst the molecular gas is for the most part gravitationally unbound, local regions within the denser parts of the gas (within the clouds) do become bound and are able to form stars. We find that the observations, in terms of distributions of virial parameters and cloud structures, can be well modelled provided that the star formation efficiency in these bound regions is of the order of 5-10 per cent. We also find that in this picture the constituent gas of individual molecular clouds changes over relatively short time-scales, typically a few Myr.},

	Abstract = {We use a sample of the 13 most luminous WMAP Galactic free-free sources, responsible for 33% of the free-free emission of the Milky Way, to investigate star formation. The sample contains 40 star-forming complexes; we combine this sample with giant molecular cloud (GMC) catalogs in the literature to identify the host GMCs of 32 of the complexes. We estimate the star formation efficiency epsilonGMC and star formation rate per free-fall time epsilonff. We find that epsilonGMC ranges from 0.002 to 0.2, with an ionizing luminosity-weighted average langepsilonGMCrang Q  = 0.08, compared to the Galactic average ≈0.005. Turning to the star formation rate per free-fall time, we find values that range up to ε_ff ≡ tau _ff \cdot \dot{M}_*/M_GMC≈ 1. Weighting by ionizing luminosity, we find an average of langepsilonffrang Q  = 0.14-0.24 depending on the estimate of the age of the system. Once again, this is much larger than the Galaxy-wide average value epsilonff = 0.006. We show that the lifetimes of GMCs at the mean mass found in our sample is 27 $\pm$ 12 Myr, a bit less than three free-fall times. The GMCs hosting the most luminous clusters are being disrupted by those clusters. Accordingly, we interpret the range in epsilonff as the result of a time-variable star formation rate; the rate of star formation increases with the age of the host molecular cloud, until the stars disrupt the cloud. These results are inconsistent with the notion that the star formation rate in Milky Way GMCs is determined by the properties of supersonic turbulence.},

	Abstract = {We present new multiwavelength submillimeter continuum measurements of the circumstellar dust around 48 young stars in the rho Ophiuchi dark clouds. Supplemented with previous 1.3 mm observations of an additional 99 objects from the literature, the statistical distributions of disk masses and submillimeter colors are calculated and compared to those in the Taurus-Auriga region. These basic submillimeter properties of young stellar objects in both environments are shown to be essentially identical. As with their Taurus counterparts, the rho Oph circumstellar dust properties are shown to evolve along an empirical evolution sequence based on the infrared spectral energy distribution. The combined rho Oph and Taurus Class II samples (173 sources) are used to set benchmark values for basic outer disk characteristics: Md~0.005 Msolar, Md/M*~1%, and alpha~2 (where Fnu~nualpha between 350 mum and 1.3 mm). The precision of these numbers is addressed in the context of substantial solid particle growth in the earliest stages of the planet formation process. There is some circumstantial evidence that disk masses inferred from submillimeter emission may be underestimated by up to an order of magnitude.},

@article{Andrews05,
	Abstract = {We present a sensitive, multiwavelength submillimeter continuum survey of 153 young stellar objects in the Taurus-Auriga star formation region. The submillimeter detection rate is 61% to a completeness limit of ~10 mJy (3 sigma) at 850 mum. The inferred circumstellar disk masses are lognormally distributed with a mean mass of ~5×10-3 Msolar and a large dispersion (0.5 dex). Roughly one-third of the submillimeter sources have disk masses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. The median disk-to-star mass ratio is 0.5%. The empirical behavior of the submillimeter continuum is best described as Fnu~nu2.0+/-0.5 between 350 mum and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of the opacity compared to the interstellar medium. The latter effect could be due to a substantial population of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown through collisional agglomeration. In this sample, the only stellar property that is correlated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. We find evidence for significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energy distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The fraction of objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fraction with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outer disks is removed nearly simultaneously.},

These objects are collisionally processed relics from the accretion disk of the Sun and, as such, they can reveal much about early conditions in the Solar system. At the cryogenic temperatures prevailing beyond Neptune, volatile ices have been able to survive since the formation epoch 4.5 Gyr ago. The Kuiper belt is the source of the Centaurs and the Jupiter-family comets. It is also a local analogue of the dust disks present around some nearby main-sequence stars. While most Kuiper belt objects are small, roughly a dozen known examples have diameters of order 1000 km or more, including Pluto and the recently discovered (and possibly larger) giant Kuiper belt objects 2003 UB313, 2003 EL61 (a binary and a triple system, resp.) and 2005 FY9.},

The distribution of cometary masses is found based on the observed distribution of cometary magnitudes corrected for observational selection effects by Everhart (1967), and a derived relationship between brightness and nucleus mass. A cloud population of 1.4 trillion comets brighter than an absolute magnitude of 11 as found by Weissman (1982) is used. The estimated total mass is 1.9 earth masses. The probable error in the estimate is about one order of magnitude. Most of the mass of the Oort cloud is concentrated in the size range of the observed long-period comets. The mass estimate is consistent with either cometary formation among the outer planets, or in satellite fragments of the primordial solar nebula.},

	Abstract = {Flattened, rotating disks of cool dust and gas extending for tens to hundreds of astronomical units are found around almost all low-mass stars shortly after their birth. These disks generally persist for several million years, during which time some material accretes onto the star, some is lost through outflows and photoevaporation, and some condenses into centimeter- and larger-sized bodies or planetesimals. Through observations mainly at IR through millimeter wavelengths, we can determine how common disks are at different ages; measure basic properties including mass, size, structure, and composition; and follow their varied evolutionary pathways. In this way, we see the first steps toward exoplanet formation and learn about the origins of the Solar System. This review addresses observations of the outer parts, beyond 1 AU, of protoplanetary disks with a focus on recent IR and (sub)millimeter results and an eye to the promise of new facilities in the immediate future.},

This is the first systematic survey of these regions to date. The clusters range in size from several stars to a few hundred stars. Thirty fields ranging in size from 8'×8' to 30'×60' were mapped with 47" resolution simultaneously in the two J=1-0 lines at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory. Seventeen sources were mapped over fields ranging in size from 3'×3' to 13'×13' in the J=2-1 line with 35" resolution at the Submillimeter Telescope Observatory. We compare the cloud properties derived from each of the three tracers in order to better understand systematic uncertainties in determining masses and line widths. Cloud masses are determined independently using the 13CO and C18O transitions; these masses range from 30 to 4000 Msolar. Finally, we present a simple morphological classification scheme, which may serve as a rough indicator of cloud evolution.},

@article{Kalberla08,
	Abstract = {Context: The determination of the global structure of the planar and extra-planar Milky Way H I disk depends critically on a reliable database but also on reasonable assumptions about the shape of the Milky Way rotation curve.  Aims: We derive the 3D H I volume density distribution for the Galactic disk out to R ˜ 60 kpc.   Methods: Our analysis is based on parameters for the warp and rotation curve derived previously. The data are taken from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21 cm line survey.  Results: The Milky Way H I disk is significantly warped but shows a coherent structure out to R ˜ 35 kpc. The radial surface density distribution, the densities in the middle of the warped plane, and the H I scale heights all follow exponential relations. The radial scale length for the surface density distribution of the H I disk is 3.75 kpc. Gas at the outskirts for 40 ⪅ R ⪅ 60 kpc is described best by a distribution with an exponential radial scale length of 7.5 kpc and a velocity dispersion of 74 km s-1. Such a highly turbulent medium fits also well with the average shape of the high velocity profile wings observed at high latitudes. The turbulent pressure gradient of such extra-planar gas is on average in balance with the gravitational forces. About 10% of the Milky Way H I gas is in this state. The large scale H I distribution is lopsided; for R ⪆ 15 kpc there is more gas in the south. The H I flaring indicates that this asymmetry is caused by a dark matter wake, located at R ˜ 25 kpc in direction of the Magellanic System. Conclusions: The H I disk is made up of two major components. Most prominent is the normal H I disk which can be traced to R ˜ 35 kpc. This is surrounded by a patchy distribution of highly turbulent gas reaching large scale heights but also large radial distances. At the position of the Sun the exponential scale height in the z direction is 3.9 kpc. This component resembles the anomalous gas discovered previously in some galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Neutral atomic hydrogen (Hi) traces the interstellar medium (ISM) over a broad range of physical conditions. Its 21-cm emission line is a key probe of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way Galaxy. About 50 years after the first detection of the 21-cm line the exploration of the Hi distribution of the Milky Way has undergone a true renaissance. This was triggered by several large-scale 21-cm surveys that became available within the past decade. New all-sky surveys unravel the shape and volume density distribution of the gaseous disk up to its borders. High-resolution Galactic plane surveys disclose a wealth of shells, filaments, and spurs that bear witness to the recycling of matter between stars and the ISM. All these observational results indicate that the Hi gas traces a dynamical Galactic ISM with structures on all scales, from tens of astronomical units to kiloparsecs. The Galaxy can be considered to be a violent, breathing disk surrounded by highly turbulent extra-planar gas.},

	Abstract = {We created a three-dimensional distribution map of molecular gas throughout the Milky Way galaxy using the latest 12CO(J=1-0) survey data cube and the rotation curve based on the kinematic distance. The radial distribution of the molecular gas shows a central peak and a second peak around 0.5R0 (R0: the solar Galactocentric distance). The thickness of the molecular disk slightly increases from 48pc to 160pc with the Galactocentric distance within a radius range of 0-11kpc. We were able to trace the Outer, the Perseus, the Sagittarius-Carina, the Scutum-Crux, and the Norma arms as logarithmic spiral arms with pitch angles of 11$\,^{\circ}$-15$\,^{\circ}$. Considering that the pitch angles of the spiral arms are within this range, the Norma and the Outer arms seem to be identified as the same spiral arm. We could also trace a midplane displacement, whose amplitude is nearly constant inside a 10kpc radius and increases beyond this radius. The ridges of the midplane displacement form the leading spiral arms.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents interstellar H I column densities, mean H I space densities, total neutral hydrogen column densities, and total mean hydrogen space densities toward 100 stars surveyed in the L-alpha region with the U2 detector of the Copernicus satellite. The data for 47 stars are compared with OAO 2 results, and ratios of gas to E(B-V) color excess are computed for 30 'intercloud' stars, 45 'cloud' stars, and the combined sample of 75 stars. A definitive value of 5.8 x 10 to the 21st power atoms/sq cm per mag is obtained for the mean ratio of total neutral hydrogen to color excess, indicating that this ratio seems to be a constant, independent of location in the sky, except possibly toward stars with anomalous extinction. The anomalous ratio determined for Rho Oph is examined, and the galactic distribution of neutral hydrogen is evaluated. The following values are estimated for matter in the galactic plane within 500 pc of the sun: a total mean hydrogen space density of 1.15 atoms/cu cm, a mean H2 space density of 0.143 molecule/cu cm (possibly a lower limit), and a mean H I space density of 0.86 atom/cu cm (a possible overestimate).},

@article{Rachford09,
	Abstract = {We report total abundances and related parameters for the full sample of the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer survey of molecular hydrogen in 38 translucent lines of sight. New results are presented for the "second half" of the survey involving 15 lines of sight to supplement data for the first 23 lines of sight already published. We assess the correlations between molecular hydrogen and various extinction parameters in the full sample, which covers a broader range of conditions than the initial sample. In particular, we are now able to confirm that many, but not all, lines of sight with shallow far-UV extinction curves and large values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, RV = AV /E(B - V)---characteristic of larger than average dust grains---are associated with particularly low hydrogen molecular fractions (f_H_2). In the lines of sight with large RV , there is in fact a wide range in molecular fractions, despite the expectation that the larger grains should lead to less H2 formation. However, we see specific evidence that the molecular fractions in this sub-sample are inversely related to the estimated strength of the UV radiation field and thus the latter factor is more important in this regime. We have provided an update to previous values of the gas-to-dust ratio, N(Htot)/E(B - V), based on direct measurements of N(H2) and N(H I). Although our value is nearly identical to that found with Copernicus data, it extends the relationship by a factor of 2 in reddening. Finally, as the new lines of sight generally show low-to-moderate molecular fractions, we still find little evidence for single monolithic "translucent clouds" with f_H_2 ˜ 1.},

	Abstract = {We present new NH3 (1, 1), (2, 2), and (4, 4) observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array compiled with work in the literature to explore the range of conditions observed in young, massive star-forming regions. To sample the effects of evolution independent from those of distance/resolution, abundance, and large-scale environment, we compare clumps in different evolutionary stages within a single infrared dark cloud (IRDC), G32.02+0.06. We find that the early stages of clustered star formation are characterized by dense, parsec-scale filamentary structures interspersed with complexes of dense cores (<0.1 pc cores clustered in complexes separated by ~1 pc) with masses from about 10 to 100 M &sun;. The most quiescent core is the most extended while the star forming cores are denser and more compact, showing very similar column density structure before and shortly after the onset of massive star formation, with peak surface densities Sigma >~ 1 g cm-2. Quiescent cores and filaments show smoothly varying temperatures from 10 to 20 K, rising to over 40 K in star-forming cores. We calculate virial parameters for 16 cores and find that the level of support provided by turbulence is generally insufficient to support them against gravitational collapse (langalphavirrang ~ 0.6). The star-forming filaments show smooth velocity fields, punctuated by discontinuities at the sites of active star formation. We discuss the massive molecular filament (M ~ 105 M &sun;, length >60 pc) hosting the IRDC, hypothesizing that it may have been shaped by previous generations of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {Context. Disks are observed around pre-main sequence stars, but how and when they form is still heavily debated. While disks around young stellar objects have been identified through thermal dust emission, spatially and spectrally resolved molecular line observations are needed to determine their nature. Only a handful of embedded rotationally supported disks have been identified to date.  Aims: We identify and characterize rotationally supported disks near the end of the main accretion phase of low-mass protostars by comparing their gas and dust structures.  Methods: Subarcsecond observations of dust and gas toward four Class I low-mass young stellar objects in Taurus are presented at significantly higher sensitivity than previous studies. The 13CO and C18O J = 2-1 transitions at 220 GHz were observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer at a spatial resolution of <=0.8" (56 AU radius at 140 pc) and analyzed using uv-space position velocity diagrams to determine the nature of their observed velocity gradient.  Results: Rotationally supported disks (RSDs) are detected around 3 of the 4 Class I sources studied. The derived masses identify them as Stage I objects; i.e., their stellar mass is higher than their envelope and disk masses. The outer radii of the Keplerian disks toward our sample of Class I sources are <=100 AU. The lack of on-source C18O emission for TMR1 puts an upper limit of 50 AU on its size. Flattened structures at radii >100 AU around these sources are dominated by infalling motion (upsilo ∝ r-1). A large-scale envelope model is required to estimate the basic parameters of the flattened structure from spatially resolved continuum data. Similarities and differences between the gas and dust disk are discussed. Combined with literature data, the sizes of the RSDs around Class I objects are best described with evolutionary models with an initial rotation of Omega = 10-14 Hz and slow sound speeds. Based on the comparison of gas and dust disk masses, little CO is frozen out within 100 AU in these disks.  Conclusions: Rotationally supported disks with radii up to 100 AU are present around Class I embedded objects. Larger surveys of both Class 0 and I objects are needed to determine whether most disks form late or early in the embedded phase.  Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer.

	Abstract = {Context. Because it is viewed simply edge-on, the HH212 protostellar system is an ideal laboratory for studying the interplay of infall, outflow, and rotation in the earliest stages of low-mass star formation.  Aims: We wish to exploit the unmatched combination of high angular resolution, high sensitivity, high-imaging fidelity, and spectral coverage provided by ALMA to shed light on the complex kinematics of the innermost central regions of HH212.  Methods: We mapped the inner 10" (4500 AU) of the HH212 system at ~=0.5" resolution in several molecular tracers and in the 850 mum dust continuum using the ALMA interferometer in band 7 in the extended configuration of the Early Science Cycle 0 operations.  Results: Within a single ALMA spectral set-up, we simultaneously identify all the crucial ingredients known to be involved in the star formation recipe: (i) the fast, collimated bipolar SiO jet driven by the protostar; (ii) the large-scale swept-up CO outflow; (iii) the flattened rotating and infalling envelope, with bipolar cavities carved by the outflow (in C17O(3-2)); and (iv) a rotating wide-angle flow that fills the cavities and surrounds the axial jet (in C34S(7-6)). In addition, the compact high-velocity C17O emission ($\pm$1.9-3.5 km s-1 from systemic) shows a velocity gradient along the equatorial plane consistent with a rotating disk of ~=0farcs2 = 90 AU around a ~=0.3 $\pm$ 0.1 M&sun; source. The rotating disk is possibly Keplerian.  Conclusions: HH212 is the third Class 0 protostar with possible signatures of a Keplerian disk of radius >=30 AU.

	Abstract = {Pulsar observations provide a suite of tests to which stellar and binary evolutionary theory may compare. Importantly, the number of pulsar systems found from recent surveys has increased the statistical significance of pulsar population synthesis results. To take advantage of this, we are in the process of developing a complete pulsar population synthesis code that accounts for isolated and binary pulsar evolution, Galactic spatial evolution and pulsar survey selection effects. In a recent paper, we described the first component of this code and explored how uncertainties in the parameters of binary and pulsar evolution affected the appearance of the pulsar population in terms of magnetic field and spin period. We now describe the second component which focuses on following the orbits of the pulsars within the Galactic potential. In combination with the first component, we produce synthetic populations of pulsars within our Galaxy and calculate the resulting scaleheights as well as the radial and space velocity distributions of the pulsars. Correlations between the binary and kinematic evolution of pulsars are also examined. Results are presented for isolated pulsars, binary pulsars and millisecond pulsars. We also test the robustness of the outcomes to variations in the assumed form of the Galactic potential, the birth distribution of binary positions and the strength of the velocity kick given to neutron stars at birth. We find that isolated pulsars have a greater scaleheight than binary pulsars. This is also true when restricted to millisecond pulsars unless we allow for low-mass stars to be ablated by radiation from their pulsar companion in which case the isolated and binary scaleheights are comparable. Double neutron stars are found to have a large variety of space velocities; in particular, some systems have speeds similar to the Sun. We look in detail at the predicted Galactic population of millisecond pulsars with black hole companions, including their formation pathways, and show where the short-period systems reside in the Galaxy. Some of our population predictions are compared in a limited way to observations but the full potential of this aspect will be realized in the near future when we complete our population synthesis code with the selection effects component.},

	Abstract = {We present Brut, an algorithm to identify bubbles in infrared images of the Galactic midplane. Brut is based on the Random Forest algorithm, and uses bubbles identified by >35,000 citizen scientists from the Milky Way Project to discover the identifying characteristics of bubbles in images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. We demonstrate that Brut's ability to identify bubbles is comparable to expert astronomers. We use Brut to re-assess the bubbles in the Milky Way Project catalog, and find that 10%-30% of the objects in this catalog are non-bubble interlopers. Relative to these interlopers, high-reliability bubbles are more confined to the mid-plane, and display a stronger excess of young stellar objects along and within bubble rims. Furthermore, Brut is able to discover bubbles missed by previous searches---particularly bubbles near bright sources which have low contrast relative to their surroundings. Brut demonstrates the synergies that exist between citizen scientists, professional scientists, and machine learning techniques. In cases where "untrained" citizens can identify patterns that machines cannot detect without training, machine learning algorithms like Brut can use the output of citizen science projects as input training sets, offering tremendous opportunities to speed the pace of scientific discovery. A hybrid model of machine learning combined with crowdsourced training data from citizen scientists can not only classify large quantities of data, but also address the weakness of each approach if deployed alone.},

	Abstract = {We present the detection of a dust continuum source at 3 mm (CARMA) and 1.3 mm (Submillimeter Array, SMA), and 12CO (2-1) emission (SMA) toward the L1451-mm dense core. These detections suggest a compact object and an outflow where no point source at mid-infrared wavelengths is detected using Spitzer. An upper limit for the dense core bolometric luminosity of 0.05 L &sun; is obtained. By modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution and the continuum interferometric visibilities simultaneously, we confirm that a central source of heating is needed to explain the observations. This modeling also shows that the data can be well fitted by a dense core with a young stellar object (YSO) and a disk, or by a dense core with a central first hydrostatic core (FHSC). Unfortunately, we are not able to decide between these two models, which produce similar fits. We also detect 12CO (2-1) emission with redshifted and blueshifted emission suggesting the presence of a slow and poorly collimated outflow, in opposition to what is usually found toward YSOs but in agreement with prediction from simulations of an FHSC. This presents the best candidate, so far, for an FHSC, an object that has been identified in simulations of collapsing dense cores. Whatever the true nature of the central object in L1451-mm, this core presents an excellent laboratory to study the earliest phases of low-mass star formation.

	Abstract = {We present a new near-field cosmological probe of the initial mass function (IMF) of the first stars. Specifically, we constrain the lower-mass limit of the Population III (Pop III) IMF with the total number of stars in large, unbiased surveys of the Milky Way bulge and halo. We model the early star formation history in a Milky-Way like halo with a semi-analytic approach, based on Monte-Carlo sampling of dark matter merger trees, combined with a treatment of the most important feedback mechanisms, such as stellar radiation and metal enrichment. Assuming a logarithmically flat Pop III IMF and varying its low mass limit, we derive the number of expected survivors of these first stars, using them to estimate the probability to detect any such Pop III fossil in stellar archaeological surveys. Our model parameters are calibrated with existing empirical constraints, such as the optical depth to Thomson scattering. Following our analysis, the most promising region to find possible Pop III survivors is the stellar halo of the Milky Way, which is the best target for future surveys. We find that if no genuine Pop III survivor is detected in a sample size, of $4 \times 10^6$ ($2 \times 10^7$) halo stars with well-controlled selection effects, then we can exclude the hypothesis that the primordial IMF extended down below $0.8 M_\odot$ at a confidence level of 68% (99%). With the sample size of the Hamburg/ESO survey, we can tentatively exclude Pop III stars with masses below $0.65 M_\odot$ with a confidence level of 95%, although this is subject to significant uncertainties. To fully harness the potential of our approach, future large surveys are needed that employ uniform, unbiased selection strategies for high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of a further five recycled pulsar systems in the mid-Galactic latitude portion of the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) Survey. The pulsars have rotational periods ranging from 2 ms to 66 ms, and four are in binary systems with orbital periods between 10.8 hours and 9.0 days. Three of these binary systems are particularly interesting; PSR J1227-6208 has a pulse period of 34.5 ms and the highest mass function of all pulsars with near-circular orbits. The circular orbit suggests that the companion is not another neutron star, so future timing experiments may reveal one of the heaviest white dwarfs ever found ($>$ 1.3 M$_\odot$). Timing observations of PSR J1431$-$4715 indicate that it is eclipsed by its companion which has a mass indicating it belongs to the redback class of eclipsing millisecond pulsars. PSR J1653-2054 has a companion with a minimum mass of only $0.08$ M$_\odot$, placing it among the class of pulsars with low-mass companions. Unlike the majority of such systems, however, no evidence of eclipses is seen at 1.4 GHz.},

@article{Thomas11,
	Abstract = {This work aims to study the distribution of the luminous and dark matter in Coma early-type galaxies. Dynamical masses obtained under the assumption that mass follows light do not match with the masses of strong gravitational lens systems of similar velocity dispersions. Instead, dynamical fits with dark matter haloes are in good agreement with lensing results. We derive mass-to-light ratios of the stellar populations from Lick absorption line indices, reproducing well the observed galaxy colours. Even in dynamical models with dark matter haloes the amount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with the galaxy velocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function (IMF). While galaxies around sigmaeff≈ 200 km s-1 are consistent with a Kroupa IMF, the same IMF underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigmaeff≈ 300 km s-1 by a factor of 2 and more. A systematic variation in the stellar IMF with the galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a Salpeter IMF for the most massive galaxies. If the IMF is instead constant, then some of the dark matter in high-velocity-dispersion galaxies must follow a spatial distribution very similar to that of the light. A combination of both, a varying IMF and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possible as well. For a subsample of galaxies with old stellar populations, we show that the tilt in the Fundamental Plane can be explained by systematic variations of the total (stellar + dark) mass inside the effective radius. We tested commonly used mass estimator formulae, finding them accurate at the 20-30 per cent level.},

	Abstract = {Recent mass measurements of two binary millisecond pulsars, PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807 with a mass M=1.97+/-0.04 Msun and M=1.26+/-0.14 Msun respectively indicate a large span of masses for such objects, and possibly also a broad spectrum of neutron star masses born in core-collapse supernovae. Starting from a zero-age main sequence binary stage, we aim at inferring the masses of the progenitor neutron star of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807 by taking into account the differences in the evolutionary stages preceding their formation. Using simulations for the evolution of binary stars we reconstruct the evolutionary tracks leading to the formation of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807. We analyse in detail the spin evolution due to the accretion of matter from a disk in the medium-mass/low-mass X-ray binary. General relativistic effects and the damping of surface magnetic field associated with accretion are accounted for. We consider two equations of state of dense matter, one for purely nucleonic matter and the other one including a high density softening due to the appearance of hyperons, together with a selection of models for the neutron star magnetic field and its decay. The estimated mass of the progenitor neutron stars of PSR J0751+1807 and PSR J1614-2230 could be as small as 1.1 Msun and 1.9 Msun, respectively. These values weakly depend on the equation of state and the assumed model for the polar magnetic field and its accretion-induced decay. The masses of progenitor neutron star of recycled pulsars span over a broad interval, from 1.1 Msun to 1.9 Msun. Including the effect of a slow Roche-lobe detachment phase, which as suggested recently by Tauris could be relevant for PSR J0751+1807, would make the lower mass limit even smaller. A realistic theory for core-collapse supernovae should account for this large range of mass.},

	Abstract = {Using the STARTRACK binary population synthesis code we model the population of double neutron stars in the Galaxy. We include a detailed treatment of the spin evolution of each pulsar due to processes such as spin-down and spin-up during accretion events as well as magnetic field decay. We also model the spatial distribution of double neutron stars by including their natal kicks and subsequent propagation in the Galactic gravitational potential. This synthetic pulsar population is compared to the observed sample of double neutron stars taking into account the selection effects of detection in the radio band, to determine the most likely evolutionary parameters. With these parameters we determine the properties of the double neutron star binaries detectable in gravitational waves by the high-frequency interferometers LIGO and VIRGO. In particular, we discuss the distributions of chirp masses and mass ratios in samples selected by their radio or gravitational wave emission.},

	Abstract = {We analyze binary population models of double-neutron stars and compare results to the accurately measured orbital periods and eccentricities of the eight known such systems in our Galaxy. In contrast to past similar studies, we especially focus on the dominant evolutionary channels (we identify three); for the first time, we use a detailed understanding of the evolutionary history of three double neutron stars as actual constraints on the population models. We find that the evolutionary constraints derived from the double pulsar are particularly tight, and less than half of the examined models survive the full set of constraints. The top-likelihood surviving models yield constraints on the key binary evolution parameters, but most interestingly reveal (i) the need for electron-capture supernovae from relatively low-mass degenerate, progenitor cores, and (ii) the most likely evolutionary paths for the rest of the known double neutron stars. In particular, we find that J1913+16 likely went through a phase of Case BB mass transfer, and J1906+0746 and J1756-2251 are consistent with having been formed in electron-capture supernovae.},

	Abstract = {Among the current sample of over 2000 radio pulsars known primarily in the disk of our Galaxy, millisecond pulsars now number almost 200. Due to the phenomenal success of blind surveys of the Galactic field, and targeted searches of Fermi gamma-ray sources, for the first time in over a decade, Galactic millisecond pulsars now outnumber their counterparts in globular clusters! In this paper, I briefly review earlier results from studies of the Galactic millisecond pulsar population and present new constraints based on a sample of 60 millisecond pulsars discovered by 20 cm Parkes multibeam surveys. I present a simple model of the population containing ~ 30,000 potentially observable millisecond pulsars with a luminosity function, radial distribution and scale height that matches the observed sample of objects. This study represents only a first step towards a more complete understanding of the parent population of millisecond pulsars in the Galaxy and I conclude with some suggestions for further study in this area.},

@article{Goodman14,
	Abstract = {The very long and thin infrared dark cloud "Nessie" is even longer than had been previously claimed, and an analysis of its Galactic location suggests that it lies directly in the Milky Way's mid-plane, tracing out a highly elongated bone-like feature within the prominent Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm. Re-analysis of mid-infrared imagery from the Spitzer Space Telescope shows that this IRDC is at least 2, and possibly as many as 5 times longer than had originally been claimed by Nessie's discoverers (Jackson et al. 2010); its aspect ratio is therefore at least 300:1, and possibly as large as 800:1. A careful accounting for both the Sun's offset from the Galactic plane ($\sim 25$ pc) and the Galactic center's offset from the $(l^{II},b^{II})=(0,0)$ position shows that the latitude of the true Galactic mid-plane at the 3.1 kpc distance to the Scutum-Centaurus Arm is not $b=0$, but instead closer to $b=-0.4$, which is the latitude of Nessie to within a few pc. An analysis of the radial velocities of low-density (CO) and high-density (${\rm NH}_3$) gas associated with the Nessie dust feature suggests that Nessie runs along the Scutum-Centaurus Arm in position-position-velocity space, which means it likely forms a dense `spine' of the arm in real space as well. The Scutum-Centaurus arm is the closest major spiral arm to the Sun toward the inner Galaxy, and, at the longitude of Nessie, it is almost perpendicular to our line of sight, making Nessie the easiest feature to see as a shadow elongated along the Galactic Plane from our location. Future high-resolution dust mapping and molecular line observations of the harder-to-find Galactic "bones" should allow us to exploit the Sun's position above the plane to gain a (very foreshortened) view "from above" of the Milky Way's structure.},

	Abstract = {Context. The temperature and density structure of molecular cloud cores are the most important physical quantities that determine the course of the protostellar collapse and the properties of the stars they form. Nevertheless, density profiles often rely either on the simplifying assumption of isothermality or on observationally poorly constrained model temperature profiles. The instruments of the Herschel satellite provide us for the first time with both the spectral coverage and the spatial resolution that is needed to directly measure the dust temperature structure of nearby molecular cloud cores.  Aims: With the aim of better constraining the initial physical conditions in molecular cloud cores at the onset of protostellar collapse, in particular of measuring their temperature structure, we initiated the guaranteed time key project (GTKP) "The Earliest Phases of Star Formation" (EPoS) with the Herschel satellite. This paper gives an overview of the low-mass sources in the EPoS project, the Herschel and complementary ground-based observations, our analysis method, and the initial results of the survey.  Methods: We study the thermal dust emission of 12 previously well-characterized, isolated, nearby globules using FIR and submm continuum maps at up to eight wavelengths between 100 mum and 1.2 mm. Our sample contains both globules with starless cores and embedded protostars at different early evolutionary stages. The dust emission maps are used to extract spatially resolved SEDs, which are then fit independently with modified blackbody curves to obtain line-of-sight-averaged dust temperature and column density maps.  Results: We find that the thermal structure of all globules (mean mass 7 M&sun;) is dominated by external heating from the interstellar radiation field and moderate shielding by thin extended halos. All globules have warm outer envelopes (14-20 K) and colder dense interiors (8-12 K) with column densities of a few 1022 cm-2. The protostars embedded in some of the globules raise the local temperature of the dense cores only within radii out to about 5000 AU, but do not significantly affect the overall thermal balance of the globules. Five out of the six starless cores in the sample are gravitationally bound and approximately thermally stabilized. The starless core in CB 244 is found to be supercritical and is speculated to be on the verge of collapse. For the first time, we can now also include externally heated starless cores in the Lsmm/Lbol vs. Tbol diagram and find that Tbol < 25 K seems to be a robust criterion to distinguish starless from protostellar cores, including those that only have an embedded very low-luminosity object.

The magnetic field is substantially more important than turbulence in the evolution of the system, and the initial misalignment of the magnetic and spin axes may have been important in the formation of the binary system.},

	Abstract = {We examine variations of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in extreme environments within the formalism derived by Hennebelle \& Chabrier. We focus on conditions encountered in progenitors of massive early type galaxies and starburst regions. We show that, when applying the concept of turbulent Jeans mass as the characteristic mass for fragmentation in a turbulent medium, instead of the standard thermal Jeans mass for purely gravitational fragmentation, the peak of the IMF in such environments is shifted towards smaller masses, leading to a bottom-heavy IMF, as suggested by various observations. In very dense and turbulent environments, we predict that the high-mass tail of the IMF can become even steeper than the standard Salpeter IMF, with a limit for the power law exponent $\alpha\simeq -2.7$, in agreement with recent observational determinations. This steepening is a direct consequence of the high densities and Mach values in such regions but also of the time dependence of the fragmentation process, as incorporated in the Hennebelle-Chabrier theory. We provide analytical parametrizations of these IMFs in such environments, to be used in galaxy evolution calculations. We also calculate the star formation rates and the mass-to-light ratios expected under such extreme conditions and show that they agree well with the values inferred in starburst environments and massive high-redshift galaxies. This reinforces the paradigm of star formation as being a universal process, i.e. the direct outcome of gravitationally unstable fluctuations in a density field initially generated by large scale shock-dominated turbulence. This globally enables us to infer the variations of the stellar IMF and related properties for atypical galactic conditions.},

	Abstract = {The recent discovery of a 2 M&sun; binary millisecond pulsar not only has important consequences for the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities but also raises the interesting question of whether the neutron star PSR J1614-2230 was born massive. The answer is vital for understanding neutron star formation in core collapse supernovae. Furthermore, this system raises interesting issues about the nature of the progenitor binary and how it evolved during its mass-exchanging X-ray phase. In this paper we discuss the progenitor evolution of PSR J1614-2230. We have performed detailed stellar evolution modelling of intermediate-mass X-ray binaries undergoing Case A Roche lobe overflow (RLO) and applied an analytic parametrization for calculating the outcome of either a common envelope evolution or the highly super-Eddington isotropic re-emission mode. We find two viable possibilities for the formation of the PSR J1614-2230 system: either it contained a 2.2-2.6 M&sun; giant donor star and evolved through a common envelope and spiral-in phase or, more likely, it descended from a close binary system with a 4.0-5.0 M&sun; main-sequence donor star via Case A RLO. We conclude that the neutron star must have been born with a mass of either ˜1.95 M&sun; or 1.7 $\pm$ 0.15 M&sun;, which significantly exceeds neutron star birth masses in previously discovered radio pulsar systems. Based on the expected neutron star birth masses from considerations of stellar evolution and explosion models, we find it likely that the progenitor star of PSR J1614-2230 was more massive than 20 M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution, high dynamic range column-density and color-temperature maps of the Orion complex using a combination of Planck dust-emission maps, Herschel dust-emission maps, and 2MASS NIR dust-extinction maps. The column-density maps combine the robustness of the 2MASS NIR extinction maps with the resolution and coverage of the Herschel and Planck dust-emission maps and constitute the highest dynamic range column-density maps ever constructed for the entire Orion complex, covering 0.01 mag < AK < 30 mag, or 2 × 1020 cm-2 < N < 2 × 1023 cm-2. We determined the ratio of the 2.2 mum extinction coefficient to the 850mum opacity and found that the values obtained for both Orion A and B are significantly lower than the predictions of standard dust models, but agree with newer models that incorporate icy silicate-graphite conglomerates for the grain population. We show that the cloud projected probability distribution function, over a large range of column densities, can be well fitted by a simple power law. Moreover, we considered the local Schmidt-law for star formation, and confirm earlier results, showing that the protostar surface density Sigma* follows a simple law Sigma* ∝ Sigmagasbeta, with beta ~ 2.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) interstellar medium (ISM) maps can be used to locate not only interstellar (IS) clouds, but also IS bubbles between the clouds that are blown by stellar winds and supernovae, and that are filled by hot gas. To demonstrate this and to derive a clearer picture of the local ISM, we compare our recent 3D maps of the IS dust distribution to the ROSAT diffuse X-ray background maps after removing heliospheric emission. In the Galactic plane, there is a good correspondence between the locations and extents of the mapped nearby cavities and the soft (0.25 keV) background emission distribution, showing that most of these nearby cavities contribute to this soft X-ray emission. Assuming a constant dust-to-gas ratio and homogeneous 106 K hot gas filling the cavities, we modeled the 0.25 keV surface brightness in a simple way along the Galactic plane as seen from the Sun, taking the absorption by the mapped clouds into account. The data-model comparison favors the existence of hot gas in the solar neighborhood, the so-called Local Bubble (LB). The inferred average mean pressure in the local cavities is found to be on the order of 10 000 cm-3 K, in agreement with previous studies, providing a validation test for the method. On the other hand, the model overestimates the emission from the huge cavities located in the third quadrant. Using CaII absorption data, we show that the dust-to-CaII ratio is very low in this region, implying there is a large quantity of lower temperature (non-X-ray emitting) ionized gas and, as a consequence, a reduction in the volume filled by hot gas, explaining at least part of the discrepancy. In the meridian plane, the main two brightness enhancements coincide well with the LB's most elongated parts and chimneys connecting the LB to the halo, but no particular nearby cavity is found towards the enhancement in the direction of the bright North Polar Spur (NPS) at high latitude. We searched in the 3D maps for the source regions of the higher energy (0.75 keV) enhancements in the fourth and first quadrants. Tunnels and cavities are found to coincide with the main bright areas; however, no tunnel or cavity is found to match the low-latitude b ≳ 8$\,^{\circ}$, brightest part of the NPS. In addition, the comparison between the 3D maps and published spectral data do not favor the nearby cavities being located within ~200 pc as potential source regions for the NPS. Those examples illustrate the potential use of more detailed 3D distributions of the nearby ISM for interpreting the diffuse soft X-ray background.},

	Abstract = {The disruption of the M33 galaxy is evident from its extended gaseous structure. We present new data from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array H I (GALFA-H I) Survey that show the full extent and detailed spatial and kinematic structure of M33's neutral hydrogen. Over 18% of the H I mass of M33 (M_HI_{tot}=1.4 × 10^9 M sun) is found beyond the star-forming disk as traced in the far-ultraviolet (FUV). The most distinct features are extended warps, an arc from the northern warp to the disk, diffuse gas surrounding the galaxy, and a southern cloud with a filament back to the galaxy. The features extend out to 22 kpc from the galaxy center (18 kpc from the edge of the FUV disk), and the gas is directly connected to M33's disk. Only five discrete clouds (i.e., gas not directly connected to M33 in position-velocity space) are cataloged in the vicinity of M33, and these clouds show similar properties to Galactic and M31 halo clouds. M33's gaseous features most likely originate from the tidal disruption of M33 by M31 1-3 Gyr ago as shown by an orbit analysis which results in a tidal radius <15 kpc in the majority of M33's possible orbits. M33 is now beyond the disruptive gravitational influence of M31, and the gas appears to be returning to M33's disk and redistributing its star formation fuel. M33's high mean velocity dispersion in the disk (~18.5 km s-1) may also be consistent with the previous interaction and high rate of star formation. M33 will either exhaust its star formation fuel in the next few Gyrs or eventually become star formation fuel for M31. The latter represents the accretion of a large gaseous satellite by a spiral galaxy, similar to the Magellanic Clouds' relationship to the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Positional, structural, and dynamical parameters for all dwarf galaxies in and around the Local Group are presented, and various aspects of our observational understanding of this volume-limited sample are discussed. Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates reliably placing them within 3 Mpc of the Sun are identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible "floor" in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic survey of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxy Segue 1. We have obtained velocity measurements for 98.2% of the stars within 67 pc (10', or 2.3 half-light radii) of the center of Segue 1 that have colors and magnitudes consistent with membership, down to a magnitude limit of r = 21.7. Based on photometric, kinematic, and metallicity information, we identify 71 stars as probable Segue 1 members, including some as far out as 87 pc. After correcting for the influence of binary stars using repeated velocity measurements, we determine a velocity dispersion of 3.7+1.4 - 1.1 km s-1. The mass within the half-light radius is 5.8+8.2 - 3.1 × 105 M sun. The stellar kinematics of Segue 1 require very high mass-to-light ratios unless the system is far from dynamical equilibrium, even if the period distribution of unresolved binary stars is skewed toward implausibly short periods. With a total luminosity less than that of a single bright red giant and a V-band mass-to-light ratio of 3400 M sun/L sun, Segue 1 is the darkest galaxy currently known. We critically re-examine recent claims that Segue 1 is a tidally disrupting star cluster and that kinematic samples are contaminated by the Sagittarius stream. The extremely low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -3) of two Segue 1 stars and the large metallicity spread among the members demonstrate conclusively that Segue 1 is a dwarf galaxy, and we find no evidence in favor of tidal effects. We also show that contamination by the Sagittarius stream has been overestimated. Segue 1 has the highest estimated dark matter density of any known galaxy and will therefore be a prime testing ground for dark matter physics and galaxy formation on small scales.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

@article{Clark14,
	Abstract = {We present observations of a new group of structures in the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium (ISM): slender, linear H I features we dub "fibers" that extend for many degrees at high Galactic latitude. To characterize and measure the extent and strength of these fibers, we present the Rolling Hough Transform, a new machine vision method for parameterizing the coherent linearity of structures in the image plane. With this powerful new tool we show that the fibers are oriented along the interstellar magnetic field as probed by starlight polarization. We find that these low column density (N_{H\,\scriptsize{I}} \simeq 5 \times 10^{18} cm--2) fiber features are most likely a component of the local cavity wall, about 100 pc away. The H I data we use to demonstrate this alignment at high latitude are from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array H I (GALFA-H I) Survey and the Parkes Galactic All Sky Survey. We find better alignment in the higher resolution GALFA-H I data, where the fibers are more visually evident. This trend continues in our investigation of magnetically aligned linear features in the Riegel-Crutcher H I cold cloud, detected in the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. We propose an application of the RHT for estimating the field strength in such a cloud, based on the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We conclude that data-driven, quantitative studies of ISM morphology can be very powerful predictors of underlying physical quantities.},

	Abstract = {Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) are a class of pulsars characterized by sporadic bursts of radio emission, which make them difficult to detect in typical periodicity-based pulsar searches. Using newly developed post-processing techniques for automatically identifying single bright astrophysical pulses, such as those emitted from RRATs, we have discovered approximately 30 new RRAT candidates in data from the Green Bank Telescope 350 MHz drift-scan survey. A total of 6 of these have already been confirmed and the remainder look extremely promising. Here we describe these techniques and present the most recent results on these new RRAT candidates.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted two pilot surveys for radio pulsars and fast transients with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) around 140 MHz and here report on the first low-frequency fast-radio burst limit and the discovery of two new pulsars. The first survey, the LOFAR Pilot Pulsar Survey (LPPS), observed a large fraction of the northern sky, ~1.4 x 10^4 sq. deg, with 1-hr dwell times. Each observation covered ~75 sq. deg using 7 independent fields formed by incoherently summing the high-band antenna fields. The second pilot survey, the LOFAR Tied-Array Survey (LOTAS), spanned ~600 sq. deg, with roughly a 5-fold increase in sensitivity compared with LPPS. Using a coherent sum of the 6 LOFAR "Superterp" stations, we formed 19 tied-array beams, together covering 4 sq. deg per pointing. From LPPS we derive a limit on the occurrence, at 142 MHz, of dispersed radio bursts of < 150 /day/sky, for bursts brighter than S > 107 Jy for the narrowest searched burst duration of 0.66 ms. In LPPS, we re-detected 65 previously known pulsars. LOTAS discovered two pulsars, the first with LOFAR or any digital aperture array. LOTAS also re-detected 27 previously known pulsars. These pilot studies show that LOFAR can efficiently carry out all-sky surveys for pulsars and fast transients, and they set the stage for further surveying efforts using LOFAR and the planned low-frequency component of the Square Kilometer Array.},

	Abstract = {We report initial results from AO327, a drift survey for pulsars with the Arecibo telescope at 327 MHz. The first phase of AO327 will cover the sky at declinations of -1$\,^{\circ}$ to 28$\,^{\circ}$, excluding the region within 5$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic plane, where high scattering and dispersion make low-frequency surveys sub-optimal. We record data from a 57 MHz bandwidth with 1024 channels and 125 mus sampling time. The 60 s transit time through the AO327 beam means that the survey is sensitive to very tight relativistic binaries even with no acceleration searches. To date we have detected 44 known pulsars with periods ranging from 3 ms to 2.21 s and discovered 24 new pulsars. The new discoveries include 3 ms pulsars, three objects with periods of a few tens of milliseconds typical of young as well as mildly recycled pulsars, a nuller, and a rotating radio transient. Five of the new discoveries are in binary systems. The second phase of AO327 will cover the sky at declinations of 28$\,^{\circ}$-38$\,^{\circ}$. We compare the sensitivity and search volume of AO327 to the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey and the GBT350 drift survey, both of which operate at 350 MHz.},

	Abstract = {Recent discoveries of highly dispersed millisecond radio bursts by Thornton et al. in a survey with the Parkes radio telescope at 1.4 GHz point towards an emerging population of sources at cosmological distances whose origin is currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower radio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could be detectable at redshifts out to about z = 0.5 in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a source model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric luminosities ˜8 × 1044 ergs s-1 uniformly distributed per unit comoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as a function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by Thornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and redshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in Arecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array survey by Siemion et al. is consistent with our model. Ongoing surveys in the 1-2 GHz band should result in further discoveries. At lower frequencies, assuming a typical radio spectral index alpha = -1.4, the predicted peak flux densities are 10 s of Jy. As a result, surveys of such a population with current facilities would not necessarily be sensitivity limited and could be carried out with small arrays to maximize the sky coverage. We predict that sources may already be present in 350 MHz surveys with the Green Bank Telescope. Surveys at 150 MHz with 30 deg2 fields of view could detect one source per hour above 30 Jy.},

Currently, the Magellanic Clouds are the only galaxies except for Milky Way known to harbor radio pulsars, with a total of 20 pulsars being discovered there to date. Discovery of pulsars in other galaxies can be used to trace the history of massive star formation and would allow to probe the intermediate intergalactic medium. We selected 22 galaxies of the Local Group at high galactic latitudes, |b| > 26 deg, with most of them being dwarf spheroidals with old star population. This makes them promising targets to search for giant pulses from recycled millisecond pulsars. Both single-pulse and periodicity searches were performed for trial dispersion measures up to 1000. No extragalactic pulsars are found in half of the selected targets processed so far. I will give the overview of our targetted searches, present potential candidates and discuss the obtained results.},

	Abstract = {The stellar encounter rate Gamma has been shown to be strongly correlated with the number of X-ray binaries in globular clusters (GCs) and also to the number of radio pulsars. However, the pulsar populations in different GCs show remarkably different characteristics: in some GCs the population is dominated by binary systems, in others by single pulsars and exotic systems that result from exchange encounters. In this paper, we describe a second dynamical parameter for GCs, the encounter rate for a single binary, gamma. We find that this parameter provides a good characterization of the differences between the pulsar populations of different GCs. The higher gamma is for any particular GC, the more isolated pulsars and products of exchange interactions are observed. Furthermore, we also find that slow and "young" pulsars are found almost exclusively in clusters with a high gamma; this suggests that these kinds of objects are formed by the disruption of X-ray binaries, thus halting the recycling of a previously dead neutron star. We discuss the implications of this for the nature of young pulsars and for the formation of neutron stars in GCs.},

	Abstract = {Rotation-powered millisecond radio pulsars have been spun up to their present spin period by a 108-109 yr long X-ray-bright phase of accretion of matter and angular momentum in a low-to-intermediate mass binary system. Recently, the discovery of transitional pulsars that alternate cyclically between accretion and rotation-powered states on time scales of a few years or shorter, has demonstrated this evolutionary scenario. Here, we present a thorough statistical analysis of the spin distributions of the various classes of millisecond pulsars to assess the evolution of their spin period between the different stages. Accreting sources that showed oscillations exclusively during thermonuclear type I X-ray bursts (nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars) are found to be significantly faster than rotation-powered sources, while accreting sources that possess a magnetosphere and show coherent pulsations (accreting millisecond pulsars) are not. On the other hand, if accreting millisecond pulsars and eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars form a common class of transitional pulsars, these are shown to have a spin distribution intermediate between the faster nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and the slower non-eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. We interpret these findings in terms of a spin-down due to the decreasing mass-accretion rate during the latest stages of the accretion phase, and in terms of the different orbital evolutionary channels mapped by the various classes of pulsars. We summarize possible instrumental selection effects, showing that even if an unbiased sample of pulsars is still lacking, their influence on the results of the presented analysis is reduced by recent improvements in instrumentation and searching techniques.},

@article{Kiziltan10,
	Abstract = {In the absence of constraints from the binary companion or supernova remnant, the standard method for estimating pulsar ages is to infer an age from the rate of spin-down. While the generic spin-down age may give realistic estimates for normal pulsars, it can fail for pulsars with very short periods. Details of the spin-up process during the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) phase pose additional constraints on the period (P) and spin-down rates (\dot{P}) that may consequently affect the age estimate. Here, we propose a new recipe to estimate millisecond pulsar (MSP) ages that parametrically incorporates constraints arising from binary evolution and limiting physics. We show that the standard method can be improved by this approach to achieve age estimates closer to the true age while the standard spin-down age may overestimate or underestimate the age of the pulsar by more than a factor of ~10 in the millisecond regime. We use this approach to analyze the population on a broader scale. For instance, in order to understand the dominant energy loss mechanism after the onset of radio emission, we test for a range of plausible braking indices. We find that a braking index of n = 3 is consistent with the observed MSP population. We demonstrate the existence and quantify the potential contributions of two main sources of age corruption: the previously known "age bias" due to secular acceleration and "age contamination" driven by sub-Eddington progenitor accretion rates. We explicitly show that descendants of LMXBs that have accreted at very low rates (\dot{m}≪\dot{M}_{Edd}) will exhibit ages that appear older than the age of the Galaxy. We further elaborate on this technique, the implications and potential solutions it offers regarding MSP evolution, the underlying age distribution, and the post-accretion energy loss mechanism.},

@article{Tauris12,
	Abstract = {Millisecond pulsars are mainly characterized by their spin periods, B-fields and masses - quantities that are largely affected by previous interactions with a companion star in a binary system. In this paper, we investigate the formation mechanism of millisecond pulsars by considering the pulsar recycling process in both intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The IMXBs mainly lead to the formation of binary millisecond pulsars with a massive carbon-oxygen (CO) or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (ONeMg WD) companion, whereas the LMXBs form recycled pulsars with a helium white dwarf (He WD) companion. We discuss the accretion physics leading to the spin-up line in the P P&sun;-diagram and demonstrate that such a line cannot be uniquely defined. We derive a simple expression for the amount of accreted mass needed for any given pulsar to achieve its equilibrium spin and apply this to explain the observed differences of the spin distributions of recycled pulsars with different types of companions. From numerical calculations we present further evidence for significant loss of rotational energy in accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars in LMXBs during the Roche-lobe decoupling phase (Tauris 2012) and demonstrate that the same effect is negligible in IMXBs. We examine the recycling of pulsars with CO WD companions via Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) of naked helium stars in post-common envelope binaries. We find that such pulsars typically accrete of the order of 0.002-0.007 M&sun; which is just about sufficient to explain their observed spin periods. We introduce isochrones of radio millisecond pulsars in the P P&sun;-diagram to follow their spin evolution and discuss their true ages from comparison with observations. Finally, we apply our results of the spin-up process to complement our investigation of the massive pulsar PSR J1614-2230 from Paper I, confirming that this system formed via stable Case A RLO in an IMXB and enabling us to put new constraints on the birth masses of a number of recycled pulsars.},

	Abstract = {Luminosity is an intrinsic property of radio pulsars related to the properties of the magnetospheric plasma and the beam geometry, and inversely proportional to the observing frequency. In traditional models, luminosity has been considered as a function of the spin parameters of pulsars. On the other hand, parameter independent models like power law and lognormal have been also used to fit the observed luminosities. Some of the older studies on pulsar luminosities neglected observational biases, but all of the recent studies tried to model observational effects as accurately as possible. Luminosities of pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) and in the Galactic disk have been studied separately. Older studies concluded that these two categories of pulsars have different luminosity distributions, but the most recent study concluded that those are the same. This paper reviews all significant works on pulsar luminosities and discusses open questions.},

@article{Faucher-Giguere06,
	Abstract = {We investigate the birth and evolution of Galactic isolated radio pulsars. We begin by estimating their birth space velocity distribution from proper-motion measurements of Brisken and coworkers. We find no evidence for multimodality of the distribution and favor one in which the absolute one-dimensional velocity components are exponentially distributed and with a three-dimensional mean velocity of 380+40-60 km s-1. We then proceed with a Monte Carlo-based population synthesis, modeling the birth properties of the pulsars, their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes and Swinburne Multibeam surveys. We present a population model that appears generally consistent with the observations. Our results suggest that pulsars are born in the spiral arms, with a galactocentric radial distribution that is well described by the functional form proposed by Yusifov & K{\"u}{\c c}{\"u}k, in which the pulsar surface density peaks at radius ~3 kpc. The birth spin period distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no evidence of multimodality. Models that assume the radio luminosities of pulsars to be independent of the spin periods and period derivatives are inadequate, as they lead to the detection of too many old simulated pulsars in our simulations. Dithered radio luminosities proportional to the square root of the spin-down luminosity accommodate the observations well and provide a natural mechanism for the pulsars to dim uniformly as they approach the death line, avoiding an observed pileup on the latter. There is no evidence for significant torque decay (due to magnetic field decay or otherwise) over the lifetime of the pulsars as radio sources (~100 Myr). Finally, we estimate the pulsar birthrate and total number of pulsars in the Galaxy.},

@article{Ivanova12,
	Abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) effectively produce dynamically formed low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Observers detect ~100 times more LMXBs per stellar mass in GCs compared to stars in the fields of galaxies. Observationally, metal-rich GCs are about three times more likely to contain an X-ray source than their metal-poor counterparts. Recent observations have shown that this ratio holds in extragalactic GCs for all bright X-ray sources with L X between 2 × 1037 and 5 × 1038 erg s-1. In this Letter, we propose that the observed metallicity dependence of LMXBs in extragalactic GCs can be explained by the differences in the number densities and average masses of red giants in populations of different metallicities. Red giants serve as seeds for the dynamical production of bright LMXBs via two channels - binary exchanges and physical collisions - and the increase of the number densities and masses of red giants boost LMXB production, leading to the observed difference. We also discuss a possible effect of the age difference in stellar populations of different metallicities.},

We show that the numbers of barium stars and extrinsic S stars should be dramatically reduced in these galaxies compared to what is seen in the largest elliptical galaxies. Given that the extrinsic S stars show strong Wing-Ford band and Na I D absorption, we argue that the recent claims of different initial mass functions from the most massive elliptical galaxies versus lower mass ellipticals may be the result of extrinsic S stars, rather than bottom-heavy initial mass function.},

@article{Smith14,
	Abstract = {I present a comparison between published dynamical (ATLAS3D) and spectroscopic (Conroy & van Dokkum) constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies, using the 34 galaxies in common between the two works. Both studies infer an average IMF mass factor alpha (the stellar mass relative to a Kroupa-IMF population of similar age and metallicity) greater than unity, i.e. both methods favour an IMF which is heavier than that of the Milky Way, on average over the sample. However, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, there is no correlation between alpha inferred from the two approaches. I investigate how the two estimates of alpha are correlated systematically with the galaxy velocity dispersion, sigma, and with the Mg/Fe abundance ratio. The spectroscopic method, based on the strengths of metal absorption lines, yields a correlation only with metal abundance ratios: at fixed Mg/Fe, there is no residual correlation with sigma. The dynamical method, applied to exactly the same galaxy sample, yields the opposite result: the IMF variation correlates only with dynamics, with no residual correlation with Mg/Fe after controlling for sigma. Hence, although both methods indicate a heavy IMF on average in ellipticals, they lead to incompatible results for the systematic trends, when applied to the same set of galaxies. The sense of the disagreement could suggest that one (or both) of the methods has not accounted fully for the main confounding factors, i.e. element abundance ratios or dark matter contributions. Alternatively, the poor agreement might indicate additional variation in the detailed shape of the IMF, beyond what can currently be inferred from the spectroscopic features.},

@article{Zahid14,
	Abstract = {We examine the mass-metallicity relation for z <~ 1.6. The mass-metallicity relation follows a steep slope with a turnover, or "knee," at stellar masses around 1010 M ☉. At stellar masses higher than the characteristic turnover mass, the mass-metallicity relation flattens as metallicities begin to saturate. We show that the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation depends only on the evolution of the characteristic turnover mass. The relationship between metallicity and the stellar mass normalized to the characteristic turnover mass is independent of redshift. We find that the redshift-independent slope of the mass-metallicity relation is set by the slope of the relationship between gas mass and stellar mass. The turnover in the mass-metallicity relation occurs when the gas-phase oxygen abundance is high enough that the amount of oxygen locked up in low-mass stars is an appreciable fraction of the amount of oxygen produced by massive stars. The characteristic turnover mass is the stellar mass, where the stellar-to-gas mass ratio is unity. Numerical modeling suggests that the relationship between metallicity and the stellar-to-gas mass ratio is a redshift-independent, universal relationship followed by all galaxies as they evolve. The mass-metallicity relation originates from this more fundamental universal relationship between metallicity and the stellar-to-gas mass ratio. We test the validity of this universal metallicity relation in local galaxies where stellar mass, metallicity, and gas mass measurements are available. The data are consistent with a universal metallicity relation. We derive an equation for estimating the hydrogen gas mass from measurements of stellar mass and metallicity valid for z <~ 1.6 and predict the cosmological evolution of galactic gas masses.},

	Abstract = {We describe an ongoing search for pulsars and dispersed pulses of radio emission, such as those from rotating radio transients (RRATs) and fast radio bursts, at 350 MHz using the Green Bank Telescope. With the Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument, we record 100 MHz of bandwidth divided into 4096 channels every 81.92 mus. This survey will cover the entire sky visible to the Green Bank Telescope (delta > --40$\,^{\circ}$, or 82% of the sky) and outside of the Galactic Plane will be sensitive enough to detect slow pulsars and low dispersion measure (<30 pc cm--3) millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with a 0.08 duty cycle down to 1.1 mJy. For pulsars with a spectral index of --1.6, we will be 2.5 times more sensitive than previous and ongoing surveys over much of our survey region. Here we describe the survey, the data analysis pipeline, initial discovery parameters for 62 pulsars, and timing solutions for 5 new pulsars. PSR J0214+5222 is an MSP in a long-period (512 days) orbit and has an optical counterpart identified in archival data. PSR J0636+5129 is an MSP in a very short-period (96 minutes) orbit with a very low mass companion (8 M J).

	Abstract = {We have been undertaking a comprehensive survey for pulsars and fast radio transients in the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the Milky Way using the Green Bank Radio Telescope operating at a central frequency of 350 MHz. Our search pipeline allows the detection of periodical signals and single dispersed pulses and it is optimized to search for millisecond radio pulsars. Here we present preliminary results of the searches we have conducted in the Ursa Minoris, Draco and Leo I dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. Our searches have revealed no periodic signals but a few unconfirmed millisecond single pulses at various dispersion measures, possibly related to neutron stars. Detecting neutron stars in these systems can potentially help to test the existence of haloes of dark matter surrounding these systems as predicted by Dehnen & King (2006).},

	Abstract = {We have produced a new software package for the simulation of pulsar populations, PSRPOPPY, based on the PSRPOP package. The codebase has been re-written in Python (save for some external libraries, which remain in their native Fortran), utilizing the object-oriented features of the language, and improving the modularity of the code. Pre-written scripts are provided for running the simulations in `standard' modes of operation, but the code is flexible enough to support the writing of personalised scripts. The modular structure also makes the addition of experimental features (such as new models for period or luminosity distributions) more straightforward than with the previous code. We also discuss potential additions to the modelling capabilities of the software. Finally, we demonstrate some potential applications of the code; first, using results of surveys at different observing frequencies, we find pulsar spectral indices are best fitted by a normal distribution with mean -1.4 and standard deviation 1.0. Secondly, we model pulsar spin evolution to calculate the best fit for a relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and spin parameters. We used the code to replicate the analysis of Faucher-Gigu{\`e}re & Kaspi, and have subsequently optimized their power-law dependence of radio luminosity, L, with period, P, and period derivative, P. We find that the underlying population is best described by L ∝ P-1.39$\pm$0.09 P0.48$\pm$0.04 and is very similar to that found for gamma-ray pulsars by Perera et al. Using this relationship, we generate a model population and examine the age-luminosity relation for the entire pulsar population, which may be measurable after future large-scale surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.},

@article{Kroupa01,
	Abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Deltaalpha~0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez & Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

	Abstract = {The colour-magnitude diagrams of resolved single stellar populations, such as open and globular clusters, have provided the best natural laboratories to test stellar evolution theory. Whilst a variety of techniques have been used to infer the basic properties of these simple populations, systematic uncertainties arise from the purely geometrical degeneracy produced by the similar shape of isochrones of different ages and metallicities. Here we present an objective and robust statistical technique which lifts this degeneracy to a great extent through the use of a key observable: the number of stars along the isochrone. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations we show that, for instance, we can infer the four main parameters (age, metallicity, distance and reddening) in an objective way, along with robust confidence intervals and their full covariance matrix. We show that systematic uncertainties due to field contamination, unresolved binaries, initial or present-day stellar mass function are either negligible or well under control. This technique provides, for the first time, a proper way to infer with unprecedented accuracy the fundamental properties of simple stellar populations, in an easy-to-implement algorithm.},

@article{Larson98,
	Abstract = {It has frequently been suggested in the literature that the stellar IMF in galaxies was top-heavy at early times. This would be plausible physically if the IMF depended on a mass-scale such as the Jeans mass that was higher at earlier times because of the generally higher temperatures that were present then. In this paper it is suggested, on the basis of current evidence and theory, that the IMF has a universal Salpeter-like form at the upper end, but flattens below a characteristic stellar mass that may vary with time. Much of the evidence that has been attributed to a top-heavy early IMF, including the ubiquitous G-dwarf problem, the high abundance of heavy elements in clusters of galaxies, and the high rate of formation of massive stars in high-redshift galaxies, can be accounted for with such an IMF if the characteristic stellar mass was several times higher during the early stages of galaxy evolution. However, significant variations in the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies and large amounts of dark matter in stellar remnants are not as easily explained in this way, because they require more extreme and less plausible assumptions about the form and variability of the IMF. Metal-free `population III' stars are predicted to have an IMF that consists exclusively of massive stars, and they could help to account for some of the evidence that has been attributed to a top-heavy early IMF, as well as contributing importantly to the energetics and chemical enrichment of the early Universe.},

	Abstract = {How massive stars die-what sort of explosion and remnant each produces-depends chiefly on the masses of their helium cores and hydrogen envelopes at death. For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

@article{Kochanek14,
	Abstract = {We model the observed black hole mass function under the assumption that black hole formation is controlled by the compactness of the stellar core at the time of collapse. Low compactness stars are more likely to explode as supernovae and produce neutron stars, while high compactness stars are more likely to be failed supernovae that produce black holes with the mass of the helium core of the star. Using three sequences of stellar models and marginalizing over a model for the completeness of the black hole mass function, we find that the compactness xi(2.5) above which 50% of core collapses produce black holes is xi(2.5)=0.24 (0.15 < xi(2.5) < 0.37) at 90% confidence). While models with a sharp transition between successful and failed explosions are always the most likely, the width of the transition between the minimum compactness for black hole formation and the compactness above which all core collapses produce black holes is not well constrained. The models also predict that f=0.18 (0.09 < f < 0.39) of core collapses fail assuming a minimum mass for core collapse of 8Msun. We tested four other criteria for black hole formation based on xi(2.0) and xi(3.0), the compactnesses at enclosed masses of 2.0 or 3.0 rather than 2.5Msun, the mass of the iron core, and the mass inside the oxygen burning shell. We found that xi(2.0) works as well as xi(2.5), while the compactness xi(3.0) works significantly worse, as does using the iron core mass or the mass enclosed by the oxygen burning shell. As expected from the high compactness of 20-25Msun stars, black hole formation in this mass range provides a natural explanation of the red supergiant problem.},

	Abstract = {We explore the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of a sample of 49 massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at 0.9<z<1.5. We base our analysis on intermediate resolution spectro-photometric data in the GOODS-N field taken in the near-infrared and optical with the HST/WFC3 G141 grism and the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS). To constrain the slope of the IMF, we have measured the TiO2 spectral feature, whose strength depends strongly on the content of low-mass stars, as well as on stellar age. Using ultraviolet to near-infrared individual and stacked spectral energy distributions, we have independently estimated the stellar ages of our galaxies. For the heaviest z~1 MQGs (M > 10^11.0 Msun) we find an average age of 1.7$\pm$0.3 Gyr and a bottom-heavy IMF ({\Gamma}=3.2$\pm$0.2). Lighter MQGs (10^10.5 < M < 10^11.0 Msun) at the same redshift are younger on average (1.0$\pm$0.2 Gyr) and present a shallower IMF slope ({\Gamma}=2.7$\pm$0.3). Our results are in good agreement with the findings about the IMF slope in early-type galaxies of similar mass in the present-day Universe. This suggests that the IMF, a key characteristic of the stellar populations in galaxies, is bottom-heavier for more massive galaxies and has remained unchanged in the last ~8 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We have used multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 data of the starbursting spiral galaxy M83 in order to measure variations in the upper end of the stellar initial mass function (uIMF) using the production rate of ionizing photons in unresolved clusters with ages $\leq$ 8 Myr. As in earlier papers on M51 and NGC 4214, the upper end of the stellar IMF in M83 is consistent with an universal IMF, and stochastic sampling of the stellar populations in the $\lessapprox$ 10$^{3}$ Msun clusters are responsible for any deviations in this universality. The ensemble cluster population, as well as individual clusters, also imply that the most massive star in a cluster does not depend on the cluster mass. In fact, we have found that these small clusters seem to have an over-abundance of ionizing photons when compared to an expected universal or truncated IMF. This also suggests that the presence of massive stars in these clusters does not affect the star formation in a destructive way.},

	Abstract = {Since the early 1990s with the arrival of a variety of new technologies, the capacity for authentic astronomical research at the high school level has skyrocketed. This potential, however, has not realized the bright-eyed hopes and dreams of the early pioneers who expected to revolutionise science education through the use of telescopes and other astronomical instrumentation in the classroom. In this paper, a general history and analysis of these attempts is presented. We define what we classify as an Astronomy Research in the Classroom (ARiC) project and note the major dimensions on which these projects differ before describing the 22 major student research projects active since the early 1990s. This is followed by a discussion of the major issues identified that affected the success of these projects and provide suggestions for similar attempts in the future.},

@article{Ridley13,
	Abstract = {We present the discovery of eight new radio pulsars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Five of these pulsars were found from reprocessing the Parkes Multibeam Survey of the Magellanic Clouds, while the remaining three were from an ongoing new survey at Parkes with a high-resolution data acquisition system. It is possible that these pulsars were missed in the earlier processing due to radio frequency interference, visual judgment or the large number of candidates that must be analysed. One of these new pulsars has a dispersion measure of 273 pc cm-3, almost twice the highest previously known value, making it possibly the most distant LMC pulsar. In addition, we present the null result of a radio pulse search of an X-ray point source located in SNR J0047.2-7308 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Although no millisecond pulsars have been found, these discoveries have increased the known rotation-powered pulsar population in the LMC by more than 50 per cent. Using the current sample of LMC pulsars, we used a Bayesian analysis to constrain the number of potentially observable pulsars in the LMC to within a 95 per cent credible interval of 57 000+70000-30000. The new survey at Parkes is ˜20 per cent complete, and it is expected to yield at most six millisecond pulsars in the LMC and SMC. Although it is very sensitive to short period pulsars, this new survey provides only a marginal increase in sensitivity to long periods. The limiting luminosity for this survey is 125 mJy kpc2 for the LMC which covers the upper 10 per cent of all known radio pulsars. The luminosity function for normal pulsars in the LMC is consistent with their counterparts in the Galactic disc. The maximum 1400 MHz radio luminosity for LMC pulsars is ˜1000 mJy kpc2.},

@article{Camilo00,
	Abstract = {We have used a new observing system on the Parkes radio telescope to carry out a series of pulsar observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae at 20 cm wavelength. We detected all 11 previously known pulsars and have discovered nine others, all of which are millisecond pulsars in binary systems. We have searched the data for relatively short orbital period systems, and found one pulsar with an orbital period of 96 minutes, the shortest of any known radio pulsar. The increased rate of detections with the new system resulted in improved estimates of the flux density of the previously known pulsars, determination of the orbital parameters of one of them, and a coherent timing solution for another one. Five of the pulsars now known in 47 Tucanae have orbital periods of a few hours and implied companion masses of only ~0.03 Msolar. Two of these are eclipsed at some orbital phases, while three are seen at all phases at 20 cm but not always at lower frequencies. Four and possibly six of the other binary systems have longer orbital periods and companion masses ~0.2 Msolar, with at least two of them having relatively large orbital eccentricities. All 20 pulsars have rotation periods in the range 2-8 ms.},

@article{Lyne96,
	Abstract = {Recent searches for radio pulsars in globular clusters have targeted the millisecond pulsars (MSPs) that are expected to result from the spin-up of old neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems. These surveys have been very successful, discovering 34 pulsars, most of which are old and probably recycled by accretion-powered spin-up in a binary system. However, three objects have properties that are more like those of the normal population of Galactic pulsars. Timing measurements of one such pulsar, PSR B1745-20, show that it is clearly associated with the cluster NGC 6440 and that it is solitary and young, with a large magnetic field. This pulsar, together with PSR B1820-30B in NGC 6624, establishes long-period pulsars associated with globular clusters as a distinct group that seems to have a completely different genesis to the MSP population in globular clusters. Produced at a comparable rate to the MSPs, the origin of such apparently young objects in very old stellar systems is not understood.},

	Abstract = {We report results from the initial stage of a long-term pulsar survey of the Galactic plane using the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA), a seven-beam receiver operating at 1.4 GHz with 0.3 GHz bandwidth, and fast-dump digital spectrometers. The search targets low Galactic latitudes, |b|<~5deg, in the accessible longitude ranges 32deg<~l<~77deg and 168deg<~l<~214deg. The instrumentation, data processing, initial survey observations, sensitivity, and database management are described. Data discussed here were collected over a 100 MHz passband centered on 1.42 GHz using a spectrometer that recorded 256 channels every 64 mus. Analysis of the data with their full time and frequency resolutions is ongoing. Here we report the results of a preliminary, low-resolution analysis for which the data were decimated to speed up the processing. We have detected 29 previously known pulsars and discovered 11 new ones. One of these, PSR J1928+1746, with a period of 69 ms and a relatively low characteristic age of 82 kyr, is a plausible candidate for association with the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1928+1733. Another, PSR J1906+07, is a nonrecycled pulsar in a relativistic binary with an orbital period of 3.98 hr. In parallel with the periodicity analysis, we also search the data for isolated dispersed pulses. This technique has resulted in the discovery of PSR J0628+09, an extremely sporadic radio emitter with a spin period of 1.2 s. Simulations we have carried out indicate that ~1000 new pulsars will be found in our ALFA survey. In addition to providing a large sample for use in population analyses and for probing the magnetoionic interstellar medium, the survey maximizes the chances of finding rapidly spinning millisecond pulsars and pulsars in compact binary systems. Our search algorithms exploit the multiple data streams from ALFA to discriminate between radio frequency interference and celestial signals, including pulsars and possibly new classes of transient radio sources.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using large integral field spectroscopic surveys to investigate the prevalence of galactic-scale outflows in the local Universe. Using integral field data from SAMI and the Wide Field Spectrograph, we study the nature of an isolated disk galaxy, SDSS J090005.05+000446.7 (z = 0.05386). In the integral field datasets, the galaxy presents skewed line profiles changing with position in the galaxy. The skewed line profiles are caused by different kinematic components overlapping in the line-of-sight direction. We perform spectral decomposition to separate the line profiles in each spatial pixel as combinations of (1) a narrow kinematic component consistent with HII regions, (2) a broad kinematic component consistent with shock excitation, and (3) an intermediate component consistent with shock excitation and photoionisation mixing. The three kinematic components have distinctly different velocity fields, velocity dispersions, line ratios, and electron densities. We model the line ratios, velocity dispersions, and electron densities with our MAPPINGS IV shock and photoionisation models, and we reach remarkable agreement between the data and the models. The models demonstrate that the different emission line properties are caused by major galactic outflows that introduce shock excitation in addition to photoionisation by star-forming activities. Interstellar shocks embedded in the outflows shock-excite and compress the gas, causing the elevated line ratios, velocity dispersions, and electron densities observed in the broad kinematic component. We argue from energy considerations that, with the lack of a powerful active galactic nucleus, the outflows are likely to be driven by starburst activities. Our results set a benchmark of the type of analysis that can be achieved by the SAMI Galaxy Survey on large numbers of galaxies.},

@article{Leja14,
	Abstract = {We examine the connection between the observed "star-forming sequence" (SFR $\propto$ M$_{*}^{\alpha}$) and the observed evolution of the stellar mass function between $0.2 < z < 2.5$. We find that the star-forming sequence cannot have a slope $\alpha$ $\lesssim$ 0.9 at all masses and redshifts, as this results in a much higher number density at $10 < \log(\mathrm{M}) < 11$ by $z=1$ than is observed. We show that a transition in the slope of the star-forming sequence, such that $\alpha=1$ at $\log(M)<10.5$ and $\alpha=0.7-0.13z$ \citep{whitaker12} at $\log(M)>10.5$, greatly improves agreement with the evolution of the stellar mass function. We then construct a star-forming sequence which exactly reproduces the evolution of the mass function. This star-forming sequence is also well-described by a broken-power law, with a shallow slope at high masses and a steep slope at low masses. At $z=2$, it is offset by $\sim$0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent with the mild disagreement between the cosmic SFR and the growth of the stellar mass density in recent determinations of the mass function. It is unclear whether this problem stems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects. We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in self-consistent theoretical models of galaxy evolution, including semi-analytical, hydrodynamical, and abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we show that neither mergers nor an unknown population of quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the evolution of the low-mass stellar mass function and the observed star-forming sequence. These results are supported by observations from Whitaker et al. (2014).},

@article{Martin08,
	Abstract = {We derive the structural parameters of the recently discovered very low luminosity Milky Way satellites through a maximum likelihood algorithm applied to SDSS data. For each satellite, even when only a few tens of stars are available down to the SDSS flux limit, the algorithm yields robust estimates and errors for the centroid, position angle, ellipticity, exponential half-light radius and number of member stars (within the SDSS). This latter parameter is then used in conjunction with stellar population models of the satellites to derive their absolute magnitudes and stellar masses, accounting for color-magnitude diagram shot noise. Most parameters are in good agreement with previous determinations, but we now properly account for parameter covariances. However, we find that faint satellites are somewhat more elliptical than initially thought, and ascribe this effect to the previous use of smoothed maps, which can be dominated by the smoothing (round) kernel. As a result, the faintest half of the Milky Way dwarf galaxies (MV>~-7.5) is significantly (4 sigma) flatter (<ε>=0.47+/-0.03) than its brightest half (MV<~-7.5, <ε>=0.32+/-0.02). From our best models, we also investigate whether the seemingly distorted shape of the satellites, often taken to be a sign of tidal distortion, can be quantified. We find that, except for tentative evidence of distortion in Canes Venatici I and Ursa Major II, these can be completely accounted for by Poisson scatter in the sparsely sampled systems. We consider three scenarios that could explain the rather elongated shape of faint satellites: rotation supported systems, stars following the shape of more triaxial dark matter subhalos, or elongation due to tidal interaction with the Milky Way. Although none of these is entirely satisfactory, the last one appears the least problematic, but obviously warrants much deeper observations to track evidence of such tidal interaction.},

	Abstract = {Star-formation rates (SFR) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellar mass, with a small dispersion in SSFR at fixed mass, sigma~0.3 dex. With such small scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as deterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple consequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by approximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a random walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at the previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of star-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for stochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are correlated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an expectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have a relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and its evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to constrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important observables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. The evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways to generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as mergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the classification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous formation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their star-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's insensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the ability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic baselines.

	Abstract = {We explore the ranges and distributions which will result for the intrinsic stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) values of single stellar populations, at fixed initial mass function (IMF), age and metallicity, from the discrete stochastic sampling of a probabilistic IMF. As the total mass of a certain stellar population tends to infinity, the corresponding M/L values quickly converge to fixed numbers associated with the particulars of the IMF, age, metallicity and star formation histories in question. When going to small stellar populations, however, a natural inherent spread will appear for the M/L values, which will become probabilistic quantities. For the recently discovered ultrafaint local dwarf spheroidal galaxies, with total luminosities dropping below 103LV/L&sun;, it is important to asses the amplitude of the probabilistic spread in inherent M/L values mentioned above. The total baryonic masses of these systems are usually estimated from their observed luminosities, and the assumption of a fixed, deterministic M/L value, suitable for the infinite population limit of the assumed ages and metallicities of the stellar populations in question. This total baryonic masses are crucial for testing and calibrating of structure formation scenarios, as the local ultrafaint dwarf spheroidals represent the most extreme galactic scales known. Also, subject to reliable M/L values is the use of these systems as possible discriminants between dark matter and modified gravity theories. By simulating large collections of stellar populations, each consisting of a particular collection of individual stars, we compute statistical distributions for the resulting M/L values. We find that for total numbers of stars in the range of what is observed for the local ultrafaint dwarf spheroidals, the inherent M/L values of stellar populations can be expected to vary by factors of upwards of 3, interestingly, systematically skewed towards higher values than what is obtained for the corresponding infinite stellar population limit M/L. This can serve to explain part of the spread in reported baryonic masses for these systems, which also appear as shifted systematically towards high dark-to-baryonic mass ratios at fixed stellar velocity dispersions, when going to the ultrafaint limit.},

	Abstract = {The Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA) Survey uses the ALFA 7-beam receiver to search both inner and outer Galactic sectors visible from Arecibo (32$\,^{\circ}$ <~ l <~ 77$\,^{\circ}$ and 168$\,^{\circ}$ <~ l <~ 214$\,^{\circ}$) close to the Galactic plane (|b| <~ 5$\,^{\circ}$) for pulsars. The PALFA survey is sensitive to sources fainter and more distant than have previously been seen because of Arecibo's unrivaled sensitivity. In this paper we detail a precursor survey of this region with PALFA, which observed a subset of the full region (slightly more restrictive in l and |b| <~ 1$\,^{\circ}$) and detected 45 pulsars. Detections included 1 known millisecond pulsar and 11 previously unknown, long-period pulsars. In the surveyed part of the sky that overlaps with the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey (36$\,^{\circ}$ <~ l <~ 50$\,^{\circ}$), PALFA is probing deeper than the Parkes survey, with four discoveries in this region. For both Galactic millisecond and normal pulsar populations, we compare the survey's detections with simulations to model these populations and, in particular, to estimate the number of observable pulsars in the Galaxy. We place 95% confidence intervals of 82,000 to 143,000 on the number of detectable normal pulsars and 9000 to 100,000 on the number of detectable millisecond pulsars in the Galactic disk. These are consistent with previous estimates. Given the most likely population size in each case (107,000 and 15,000 for normal and millisecond pulsars, respectively), we extend survey detection simulations to predict that, when complete, the full PALFA survey should have detected 1000^{+330}_{-230} normal pulsars and 30^{+200}_{-20} millisecond pulsars. Identical estimation techniques predict that 490^{+160}_{-115} normal pulsars and 12^{+70}_{-5} millisecond pulsars would be detected by the beginning of 2014; at the time, the PALFA survey had detected 283 normal pulsars and 31 millisecond pulsars, respectively. We attribute the deficiency in normal pulsar detections predominantly to the radio frequency interference environment at Arecibo and perhaps also scintillation---both effects that are currently not accounted for in population simulation models.},

@article{Micic06,
	Abstract = {Primordial stars are likely to be very massive (>= 30 Msolar), form in isolation, and will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centres of their host dark matter haloes. We expect primordial stars to form in haloes in the mass range 106-1010 Msolar. Some of these early black holes, formed at redshifts z >~ 10, could be the seed black holes for a significant fraction of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) found in galaxies in the local Universe. If the black hole descendants of the primordial stars exist, their merger with nearby SMBHs may be a prime candidate for long wavelength gravitational wave detectors. We simulate formation and evolution of dark matter haloes in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. We seed high-redshift dark matter haloes with early black holes, and explore the merger history of the host haloes and the implications of black hole kick velocities arising from their coalescence. The central concentration of low-mass early black holes in present-day galaxies is reduced if they experience even moderate kicks of tens of km s-1. Even such modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the low-mass black holes that were ejected, compared to those still embedded in their parent haloes. Therefore, merger rates with central SMBHs in the largest halo may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Using analytical and illustrative cosmological N-body simulations, we quantify the role of kicks on the merger rates of black holes formed from massive metal-free stars with SMBHs in present-day galaxies.},

@article{Peacock14,
	Abstract = {A number of recent studies have proposed that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of early type galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxy mass, with higher mass galaxies having bottom-heavy IMFs. These bottom-heavy IMFs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars, and therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). In this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number of BHs and NSs based on the power-law IMF variation required to reproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. We then test whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations of nearby early-type galaxies. In these binaries, an NS or BH accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. Their number is therefore expected to scale with the number of BHs and NSs present in a galaxy. We find that the number of LMXBs per K-band light is similar among the galaxies in our sample. These data therefore demonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the IMF from massive stars down to those now dominating the K-band light and are consistent with an invariant IMF. Our results are inconsistent with an IMF which varies from a Kroupa/Chabrier like IMF for low-mass galaxies to a steep power-law IMF (with slope x = 2.8) for high mass galaxies. We discuss how these observations constrain the possible forms of the IMF variations and how future Chandra observations can enable sharper tests of the IMF.

@article{Nelson14,
	Abstract = {Most massive galaxies are thought to have formed their dense stellar cores at early cosmic epochs. However, cores in their formation phase have not yet been observed. Previous studies have found galaxies with high gas velocity dispersions or small apparent sizes but so far no objects have been identified with both the stellar structure and the gas dynamics of a forming core. Here we present a candidate core in formation 11 billion years ago, at z=2.3. GOODS-N-774 has a stellar mass of 1.0x10^11 Msun, a half-light radius of 1.0 kpc, and a star formation rate of 90[+45-20]Msun/yr. The star forming gas has a velocity dispersion 317+-30 km/s, amongst the highest ever measured. It is similar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants of GOODS-N-774, compact quiescent galaxies at z~2 and giant elliptical galaxies in the nearby Universe. Galaxies such as GOODS-N-774 appear to be rare; however, from the star formation rate and size of the galaxy we infer that many star forming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical and near-infrared surveys.},

@article{Kriek09,
	Abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z ~ 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. We have obtained a ~29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z > 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M sun yr-1, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2 × 1011 M sun. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [N II]/Halpha, [S II]/Halpha, and [O II]/[O III] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes lsim8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up lsim10% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

@article{Cowie96,
	Abstract = {We present the results of spectroscopic studies with the LRIS spectrograph on Keck of two of the Hawaii deep survey fields. The 393 objects observed cover a 26.2 arcmin^2^ area and constitute a nearly complete sample down to K = 20, I = 23, and B = 24.5. The rest-frame K- band luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are described. Comparisons are made with other optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts at B ~ 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7. The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [O II] emission-line diagnostics or rest-frame ultraviolet-infrared color information are used in combination with rest-frame absolute H magnitudes to construct a "fundamental plane" in which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing redshift from a value near L_*_ at z > 1. This smooth decrease in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can simultaneously account for the high B- band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the redshift distribution at z < 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples. Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the overall rates of star formation inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet light density as a function of redshift.},

@article{Brammer08,
	Abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Qz, which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not ''trained'' on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 sigma scatter in Deltaz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

@article{Whitaker11,
	Abstract = {We present deep near-IR (NIR) medium-bandwidth photometry over the wavelength range 1-1.8 mum in the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey (AEGIS) and Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) fields. The observations were carried out using the NOAO Extremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager (NEWFIRM) on the Mayall 4 m Telescope on Kitt Peak as part of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS), an NOAO survey program. In this paper, we describe the full details of the observations, data reduction, and photometry for the survey. We also present a public K-selected photometric catalog, along with accurate photometric redshifts. The redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in the COSMOS (AEGIS) fields, combining the NIR medium-bandwidth data with existing UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible and NIR (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Subaru Telescope), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC) imaging. We find excellent agreement with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts, with sigma z /(1 + z) ~ 1%-2% for ~4000 galaxies at z = 0-3. The NMBS catalogs contain ~13,000 galaxies at z > 1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors. Due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five NIR medium-band filters, the median 68% confidence intervals of the photometric redshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of about two times smaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band NIR photometry to NIR broadband photometry. We show evidence for a clear bimodal color distribution between quiescent and star-forming galaxies that persists to z ~ 3, a higher redshift than has been probed so far.},

	Abstract = {The 3D-HST and CANDELS programs have obtained WFC3 and ACS spectroscopy and imaging over five fields, comprising a total area of ~900 sq. arcmin: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-North, GOODS-South, and the UKIDSS UDS field. All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging datasets in addition to the HST data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3um -8um. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point spread function into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging datasets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. In a companion paper (I. Momcheva et al., in preparation) we present line diagnostics and improved redshifts from an analysis of the combination of the photometry with the grism spectra. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST website.},

	Abstract = {We construct and analyse a u-band selected galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Southern Survey, which covers 275deg2. The sample includes 43223 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.005 < z < 0.3 and with 14.5 < u < 20.5. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in the u-band Petrosian aperture is improved by co-adding multiple epochs of imaging data and by including sky-subtraction corrections. Luminosity functions for the near-UV 0.1u band (lambda~ 322 +/- 26nm) are determined in redshift slices of width 0.02, which show a highly significant evolution in M* of -0.8 +/- 0.1 mag between z= 0 and 0.3; with M*-5 logh70=-18.84 +/- 0.05 (AB mag), logphi*=-2.06 +/- 0.03 (h370Mpc-3) and logrhoL= 19.11 +/- 0.02 (h70WHz-1Mpc-3) at z= 0.1. The faint-end slope determined for z < 0.06 is given by alpha=-1.05 +/- 0.08. This is in agreement with recent determinations from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer at shorter wavelengths. Comparing our z < 0.3 luminosity density measurements with 0.2 < z < 1.2 from Classifying Objects by Medium Band Observations in 17 Filters (COMBO-17), we find that the 280-nm density evolves as rhoL~ (1 +z)beta with beta= 2.1 +/- 0.2; and find no evidence for any change in slope over this redshift range. By comparing with other measurements of cosmic star formation history, we estimate that the effective dust attenuation at 280nm has increased by 0.8 +/- 0.3mag between z= 0 and 1.},

	Abstract = {We identify 73 z ~ 7 and 59 z ~ 8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch, and use this large 26-29.4 AB mag sample of galaxies to derive very deep luminosity functions to < - 18 AB mag and the star formation rate (SFR) density at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 (just 800 Myr and 650 Myr after recombination, respectively). The galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated Lyman-break technique on the full two-year Wide Field Camera 3/infrared (WFC3/IR) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data available over the HUDF09 (~29.4 AB mag, 5sigma), two nearby HUDF09 fields (~29 AB mag, 5sigma, 14 arcmin2), and the wider area Early Release Science (~27.5 AB mag, 5sigma, ~40 arcmin2). The application of strict optical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low (just ~7% in the HUDF). This very low value includes a full assessment of the contamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, active galactic nuclei, spurious sources, low-mass stars, and transients (e.g., supernovae). From careful modeling of the selection volumes for each of our search fields, we derive luminosity functions for galaxies at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 to < - 18 AB mag. The faint-end slopes alpha at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01 $\pm$ 0.21 and alpha = -1.91 $\pm$ 0.32, respectively. Such steep slopes contrast to the local alpha >~ -1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z ~ 4 where alpha = -1.73 $\pm$ 0.05. With such steep slopes (alpha <~ -1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate the galaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. The SFR densities derived from these new z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 luminosity functions are consistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). We find reasonable consistency with the SFR densities implied from reported stellar mass densities being only ~40% higher at z < 7. This suggests that (1) the stellar mass densities inferred from the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry are reasonably accurate and (2) that the initial mass function at very high redshift may not be very different from that at later times.

@article{Marchesini09,
	Abstract = {We present the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies from z = 4.0 to z = 1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deep near-infrared Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile, the Faint Infrared Extragalactic Survey, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Chandra Deep Field South surveys, all having very high-quality optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way, allowed us to (1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; (2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to ~0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of the SMF with good statistics; and (3) empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs, including the effect of metallicity, extinction law, stellar population synthesis model, and initial mass function. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor of ~17+7 -10 since z = 4.0, mostly driven by a change in the normalization Phisstarf. If only random errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are taken into account. Another significant uncertainty is the contribution to the overall stellar mass density of galaxies below our mass limit; future studies with WFC3 will provide better constraints on the SMF at masses below 1010 M sun at z>2. Taking our results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible to uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-mass end may be more difficult to explain.

	Abstract = {We explore a large uniformly selected sample of Halpha selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47, 2.23 to unveil the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) function and the stellar mass function. We find strong evolution in the SFR function, with the typical SFR of SFGs declining exponentially in the last 11 Gyr as SFR*(T[Gyr]) = 104.23/T + 0.37 M&sun; yr-1, but with no evolution in the faint-end slope, alpha ≈ -1.6. The stellar mass function of SFGs, however, reveals little evolution: alpha ≈ -1.4, M* ˜ 1011.2 $\pm$ 0.2 M&sun; and just a slight increase of ˜2.3× in Phi* from z = 2.23 to z = 0.4. The stellar mass density within SFGs has been roughly constant since z = 2.23 at ˜107.65 $\pm$ 0.08 M&sun; Mpc-3, comprising ≈100 per cent of the stellar mass density in all galaxies at z = 2.23, and declining to ≈20 per cent by z = 0.40, driven by the rise of the passive population. We find that SFGs with ˜1010.0 $\pm$ 0.2 M&sun; contribute most to the SFR density (rhoSFR) per d log10M, and that there is no significant evolution in the fractional contribution from SFGs of different masses to rhoSFR or rhoSFR(d log10M)-1 since z = 2.23. Instead, we show that the decline of SFR* and of rhoSFR is primarily driven by an exponential decline in SFRs at all masses. Our results have important implications not only on how SFGs need to be quenched across cosmic time, but also on the driver(s) of the exponential decline in SFR* from ˜66 M&sun; yr-1 to 5 M&sun; yr-1 since z ˜ 2.23.},

	Abstract = {We study the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M sstarf) relation in a self-consistent manner from 0 < z < 2.5 with 22,816 star-forming galaxies selected from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey. We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54% for log (M sstarf) > 10 at 1 < z < 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7%). The remaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

	Abstract = {Using observations from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE), we obtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) at 0.2 < z < 3. ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2 mum. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of ~109.5 M &sun; at z ~ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z <= 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses <1010 M &sun; that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z ~ 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M*) and slope at the lowest masses (alpha) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/M &sun;) ~ 10.65 and ~ - 1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 109 M &sun;) has increased by a factor of ~12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of ~2.2.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We measure spectral features of ~3500 K-selected galaxies at 0.5 < z < 2.0 from high-quality medium-band photometry using a new technique. First, we divide the galaxy sample in 32 subsamples based on the similarities between the full spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies. For each of these 32 galaxy types we construct a composite SED by de-redshifting and scaling the observed photometry. This approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio and sampling of galaxy SEDs and allows for model-independent stellar population studies. The composite SEDs are of spectroscopic quality and facilitate---for the first time---Halpha measurements for a large magnitude-limited sample of distant galaxies. The line widths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty of Deltaz < 0.02 × (1 + z). The composite SEDs also show the Balmer and 4000 {\AA} breaks, Mg II absorption at ~2800 {\AA}, the dust absorption feature at 2175 {\AA}, and blended [O III]+Hbeta emission. We compare the total equivalent width of Halpha, [N II], and [S II] (W Halpha +) with the strength of the 4000 {\AA} break (D(4000)) and the best-fit specific star formation rate, and find that all these properties are strongly correlated. This is a reassuring result, as currently most distant stellar population studies are based on just continuum emission. Furthermore, the relation between W Halpha + and D(4000) provides interesting clues to the star formation histories of galaxies, as these features are sensitive to different stellar ages. We find that the correlation between W Halpha + and D(4000) at 0.5 < z < 2.0 is similar to z ~ 0 and that the suppression of star formation in galaxies at z < 2 is generally not abrupt, but a gradual process.},

@article{Kriek10,
	Abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models are a key ingredient of many galaxy evolution studies. Unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated for certain stellar evolution stages. Of particular concern is the treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase, as different implementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties. Post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as TP-AGB stars are thought to be most prominently visible during this phase. Here, we use post-starburst galaxies in the NEWFIRM medium-band survey to assess different SPS models. The available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous and well-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7 <~ z <~ 2.0, from which we construct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (SED) over the range 1200-40000 {\AA}. The SED is well fit by the Bruzual & Charlot SPS models, while the Maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical and near-infrared parts of the SED simultaneously. When the fitting is restricted to lambda < 6000 {\AA}, the Maraston models overpredict the near-infrared luminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to TP-AGB stars. Using the flexible SPS models by Conroy et al. and assuming solar metallicity, we find that the contribution of TP-AGB stars to the integrated SED is a factor of ~3 lower than predicted by the latest Padova TP-AGB models. Whether this is due to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dust obscuration of TP-AGB stars remains to be addressed. Altogether, our data demand a low contribution from TP-AGB stars to the SED of post-starburst galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present 3D-HST, a near-infrared spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble Space Telescope for studying the physical processes that shape galaxies in the distant universe. 3D-HST provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of ~7000 galaxies at 1 < z < 3.5, the epoch when ~60% of all star formation took place, the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars, and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged. 3D-HST will cover three quarters (625 arcmin2) of the CANDELS Treasury survey area with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to four orbits with the ACS/G800L grism in parallel. In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of ~5 per resolution element at H 140 ~ 23.1 and a 5sigma emission-line sensitivity of ~5 × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 mum at a spatial resolution of ~0farcs13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of sigma(z) = 0.0034(1 + z), or sigma(v) ≈ 1000 km s-1. We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 < z < 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

	Abstract = {We select 25,000 galaxies from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey (NMBS) to study the rest-frame U - V color distribution of galaxies at 0 < z lsim 2.5. The five unique NIR filters of the NMBS enable the precise measurement of photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors for 9900 galaxies at 1 < z < 2.5. The rest-frame U - V color distribution at all z lsim 2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, a blue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). Model fits to the optical-NIR spectral energy distributions and the distribution of MIPS-detected galaxies indicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largely by the amount of reddening by dust. This result does not support the simplest interpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star forming to red quiescent galaxies. We show that correcting the rest-frame colors for dust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and blue sequences up to z ~ 2.5. Our study confirms that dusty-starburst galaxies can contribute a significant fraction to red-sequence samples selected on the basis of a single rest-frame color (i.e., U - V), so extra care must be taken if samples of truly "red and dead" galaxies are desired. Interestingly, of galaxies detected at 24 mum, 14% remain on the red sequence after applying the reddening correction.},

	Abstract = {Galactic luminosity functions (LFs) and their applications in cosmological computations are discussed in an analytical review. The history and definitions of general and more specific LFs are recalled, and it is argued that the general LF is not universal and hence of only limited value. Particular attention is given to the relationship between LF and density function, the magnitudes employed, the selection of galaxies, and methods for determining the LF for field and cluster galaxies. Recent determinations of the galactic LF, for field and cluster galaxies, over all Hubble types and for different Hubble types, and for different environments are then surveyed, and a number of outstanding theoretical and observational problems are indicated.},

	Abstract = {We present initial results of a large near-IR spectroscopic survey covering the 15 fields of the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) using the recently-commissioned MOSFIRE instrument on the Keck 1 10m telescope. We focus on 179 galaxies with redshifts 2.0 < z < 2.6, most of which have high-quality MOSFIRE spectra in both H and K-band atmospheric windows, allowing sensitive measurements of [OIII]4960,5008, H-beta, [NII]6585, and H-alpha emission lines. We show unambiguously that the locus of z~2.3 galaxies in the "BPT" nebular diagnostic diagram exhibits an almost entirely disjoint, yet similarly tight, relationship between the line ratios [NII]/Halpha and [OIII]/Hbeta as compared to local galaxies. We argue that the offset of the z~2.3 BPT locus relative to that at z~0 is caused primarily by higher excitation (driven by both higher ionization parameter and harder stellar ionizing radiation field) than applies to most local galaxies. Also unlike nearby counterparts, a z~2.3 galaxy's position along the BPT locus is surprisingly insensitive to gas-phase O/H. The observed emission line ratios are most easily reproduced by models in which the stellar ionizing radiation field has Teff=50000-60000 K, gas-phase O/H in the range 0.2 < Z/Zsun < 1.0, and gas-phase N/O close to solar. Such high sustained Teff are not easily produced by standard population synthesis models, but are expected if massive binaries and/or rapid stellar rotation are important for the evolution of main sequence O-stars in typical high-redshift galaxies. We assess the applicability of commonly-used strong line indices for estimating gas-phase metallicities of high redshift galaxies, as well as their likely systematic biases. The empirical correlation between M* and inferred metallicity (the "MZR") at z~2.3 is as tight as for local galaxy samples, but is offset to lower metallicity (at all M*) by ~0.35 dex (abridged)},

	Abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of $(106.5\,{\rm Mpc})^3$, has a dark mass resolution of ${6.26 \times 10^{6}\,{\rm M}_\odot}$, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of ${1.26 \times 10^{6}\,{\rm M}_\odot}$. At $z=0$ gravitational forces are softened on scales of $710\,{\rm pc}$, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of $48\,{\rm pc}$. We follow the dynamical evolution of $2\times 1820^3$ resolution elements and in addition passively evolve $1820^3$ Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than $18$ billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. At $z=0$ our simulation volume contains about $40,000$ well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at $z=0$. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disk galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

@article{Treu10,
	Abstract = {We determine an absolute calibration of the initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies, by studying a sample of 56 gravitational lenses identified by the Sloan Lenses ACS Survey. Under the assumption of standard Navarro, Frenk, and White dark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark matter contribution for each lens. We define an "IMF mismatch" parameter alpha≡M LD *,Ein/M SPS *,Ein as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensing and dynamical model (M LD *,Ein) to the current stellar mass inferred from stellar populations synthesis models (M SPS *,Ein). We find that a Salpeter IMF provides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing and dynamical models (langlog alpharang = -0.00 $\pm$ 0.03 $\pm$ 0.02), while a Chabrier IMF underestimates them (langlog alpharang = 0.25 $\pm$ 0.03 $\pm$ 0.02). A tentative trend is found, in the sense that alpha appears to increase with galaxy velocity dispersion. Taken at face value, this result would imply a non-universal IMF, perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellar populations. Alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal dark matter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion. While the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken without additional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannot have both a universal IMF and universal dark matter halos.

@article{Smith12,
	Abstract = {To investigate possible variations in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in red-sequence galaxies, we have obtained infrared spectroscopy with Subaru/Fibre Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS) for a sample of 92 red-sequence galaxies in the Coma cluster. Velocity dispersions, ages and element abundances for these galaxies have been previously determined from optical data. The full range of velocity dispersions covered by the sample is sigma = 50-300  km s-1. By stacking the FMOS spectra in the rest frame and removing sky-subtraction residuals and other artefacts fixed in the observed frame, we derive composite spectra in the 9600-10500 {\AA} range for galaxies grouped according to their velocity dispersion or Mg/Fe ratio. We measure the Wing-Ford band of FeH and a new index centred on a Ca I line at 10345 {\AA}; these features are strong in cool dwarf stars, and hence reflect the form of the IMF at low mass (<0.5 M&sun;). The Ca I line, unlike the Wing-Ford band and other 'classical' IMF indicators (Na I doublet and Ca II triplet), is unaffected by the abundance of sodium. We compare the measured indices against predictions from spectral synthesis models matched to the element abundances estimated from the optical data. Binning galaxies by velocity dispersion, we find that both the Wing-Ford and Ca I index measurements are best reproduced by models with the Salpeter IMF. There is no clear evidence for an increase in dwarf-star content with velocity dispersion over the range probed by our sample (which includes few galaxies at the highest velocity dispersions, sigma > 250  km s-1). Binning the observed galaxies instead by Mg/Fe ratio, the behaviour of both indices implies a trend of IMF from Chabrier-like, at abundance ratios close to solar, to Salpeter or heavier for highly alpha-enhanced populations. At face value, this suggests that the IMF depends on the mode of star formation, with intense rapid starbursts generating a larger population of low-mass stars.

	Abstract = {We present new radially resolved spectroscopy of eight early-type galaxies in the A262 cluster. The measurements include stellar rotation, velocity dispersion, H 3 and H 4 coefficients of the line-of-sight velocity distribution along the major and minor axes and an intermediate axis as well as line-strength index profiles of Mg, Fe, and Hbeta. The ionized-gas velocity and velocity dispersion is measured for six sample galaxies along different axes. We derive dynamical mass-to-light ratios and dark matter densities from orbit-based dynamical models, complemented by the galaxies' ages, metallicities, and alpha-element abundances from single stellar-population models. The ionized-gas kinematics give a valuable consistency check for the model assumptions about orientation and intrinsic shape of the galaxies. Four galaxies have a significant detection of dark matter and their halos are about 10 times denser than in spirals of the same stellar mass. By calibrating dark matter densities to cosmological simulations we find assembly redshifts of z DM ≈ 1-3, as previously reported for the Coma Cluster. The dynamical mass that follows the light is larger than expected for a Kroupa stellar initial mass function (IMF), especially in galaxies with high velocity dispersion sigmaeff inside the effective radius r eff. This could indicate a "massive" IMF in massive galaxies. Alternatively, some of the dark matter in massive galaxies could follow the light very closely. In combination with our comparison sample of Coma early-type galaxies, we now have 5 of 24 galaxies where (1) mass follows light to 1-3 r eff, (2) the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of all the mass that follows the light is large (≈8-10 in the Kron-Cousins R band), and (3) the dark matter fraction is negligible to 1-3 r eff. Unless the IMF in these galaxies is particularly "massive" and somehow coupled to the dark matter content, there seems to be a significant degeneracy between luminous and dark matter in at least some early-type galaxies. The role of violent relaxation is briefly discussed.  Based on data collected with the 2.4 m Hiltner Telescope.},

The velocity dispersion profile declines with radius, though not very steeply, down to ~70kms-1 at the last data point.  We have constructed spherical dynamical models of the system, including Jeans analyses with multi-component Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) motivated galaxies as well as logarithmic potentials. These models include special attention to orbital anisotropy, which we constrain using fourth-order velocity moments. Given several different sets of modelling methods and assumptions, we find consistent results for the mass profile within the radial range constrained by the data. Some dark matter (DM) is required by the data; our best-fitting solution has a radially anisotropic stellar halo, a plausible stellar mass-to-light ratio and a DM halo with an unexpectedly low central density. We find that this result does not substantially change with a flattened axisymmetric model.  Taken together with other results for galaxy halo masses, we find suggestions for a puzzling pattern wherein most intermediate-luminosity galaxies have very low concentration haloes, while some high-mass ellipticals have very high concentrations. We discuss some possible implications of these results for DM and galaxy formation.},

@article{Napolitano11,
	Abstract = {As part of our current programme to test LambdaCDM predictions for dark matter (DM) haloes using extended kinematical observations of early-type galaxies, we present a dynamical analysis of the bright elliptical galaxy NGC 4374 (M84) based on ˜450 planetary nebulae (PNe) velocities from the PN.Spectrograph, along with extended long-slit stellar kinematics.  This is the first such analysis of a galaxy from our survey with a radially constant velocity dispersion profile. We find that the spatial and kinematical distributions of the PNe agree with the field stars in the region of overlap.  The velocity kurtosis is consistent with zero at almost all radii.  We construct a series of Jeans models, fitting both velocity dispersion and kurtosis to help break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. Our mass models include DM haloes either with shallow cores or with central cusps as predicted by cosmological simulations - along with the novel introduction in this context of adiabatic halo contraction from baryon infall.  Both classes of models confirm a very massive dark halo around NGC 4374, demonstrating that PN kinematics data are well able to detect such haloes when present. Considering the default cosmological mass model, we confirm earlier suggestions that bright galaxies tend to have halo concentrations higher than LambdaCDM predictions, but this is found to be solved if either a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) or an adiabatic contraction with a Kroupa IMF is assumed. Thus for the first time a case is found where the PN dynamics may well be consistent with a standard dark matter halo. A cored halo can also fit the data, and prefers a stellar mass consistent with a Salpeter IMF. The less dramatic dark matter content found in lower-luminosity 'ordinary' ellipticals suggests a bimodality in the halo properties which may be produced by divergent baryonic effects during their assembly histories.

	Abstract = {We determine an absolute calibration of stellar mass-to-light ratios for the densest ~=3 per cent of early-type galaxies in the local Universe (redshift z~= 0.08) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. This sample of ˜4000 galaxies has, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), effective stellar surface densities Sigmae > 2500 M&sun; pc-2, stellar population synthesis (SPS) stellar masses log10(MSPS/M&sun;) < 10.8 and aperture velocity dispersions of ? (68 per cent range). In contrast to typical early-type galaxies, we show that these dense early-type galaxies follow the virial Fundamental Plane, which suggests that mass follows light. With the additional assumption that any dark matter does not follow the light, the dynamical masses of dense galaxies provide a direct measurement of stellar masses. Our dynamical masses (Mdyn), obtained from the spherical Jeans equations, are only weakly sensitive to the choice of anisotropy (beta) due to the relatively large aperture of the SDSS fibre for these galaxies: Rap~= 1.5Re. Assuming isotropic orbits (beta= 0), we find a median log10(Mdyn/MSPS) = 0.233 $\pm$ 0.003, consistent with a Salpeter IMF, while more bottom-heavy IMFs and standard Milky Way IMFs are strongly disfavoured. Our results are consistent with, but do not require, a dependence of the IMF on dynamical mass or velocity dispersion. We find evidence for a colour dependence to the IMF such that redder galaxies have heavier IMFs with Mdyn/MSPS∝ (g-r)1.13 $\pm$ 0.09. This may reflect a more fundamental dependence of the IMF on the age or metallicity of a stellar population, or the density at which the stars formed.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

	Abstract = {We perform a spectroscopic study to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by using a large sample of 24 781 early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-based Spheroids Panchromatic Investigation in Different Environmental Regions survey. Clear evidence is found of a trend between IMF and central velocity dispersion (sigma0), evolving from a standard Kroupa/Chabrier IMF at sigma0 ˜ 100 km s-1 towards a more bottom-heavy IMF with increasing sigma0, becoming steeper than the Salpeter function at sigma0 ≳ 220 km s-1. We analyse a variety of spectral indices, combining gravity-sensitive features, with age- and metallicity-sensitive indices, and we also consider the effect of non-solar abundance variations. The indices, corrected to solar scale by means of semi-empirical correlations, are fitted simultaneously with the (nearly solar-scaled) extended MILES (MIUSCAT) stellar population models. Similar conclusions are reached when analysing the spectra with a hybrid approach, combining constraints from direct spectral fitting in the optical with those from IMF-sensitive indices. Our analysis suggests that sigma0, rather than [alpha/Fe], drives the variation of the IMF. Although our analysis cannot discriminate between a single power-law (unimodal) IMF and a low-mass (≲0.5 M&sun;) tapered (bimodal) IMF, robust constraints can be inferred for the fraction in low-mass stars at birth. This fraction (by mass) is found to increase from ˜20 per cent at sigma0 ˜ 100 km s-1, up to ˜80 per cent at sigma0 ˜ 300 km s-1. However, additional constraints can be provided with stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios: unimodal models predict M/L significantly larger than dynamical M/L, across the whole sigma0 range, whereas a bimodal IMF is compatible. Our results are robust against individual abundance variations. No significant variation is found in Na and Ca in addition to the expected change from the correlation between [alpha/Fe] and sigma0.},

	Abstract = {We measure equivalent widths (EWs)---focusing on two unique features (NaI and TiO2) of low-mass stars (lsim 0.3 M &sun;)---for luminous red galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and X-Shooter Lens Survey (XLENS) in order to study the low-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). We compare these EWs to those derived from simple stellar population models computed with different IMFs, ages, [alpha/Fe], and elemental abundances. We find that models are able to simultaneously reproduce the observed NaD lambda5895 and Na I lambda8190 features for lower-mass (~sigma*) early-type galaxies (ETGs) but deviate increasingly for more massive ETGs, due to strongly mismatching NaD EWs. The TiO2 lambda6230 and the Na I lambda8190 features together appear to be a powerful IMF diagnostic, with age and metallicity effects orthogonal to the effect of IMF. We find that both features correlate strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion. The XLENS ETG (SDSS J0912+0029) and an SDSS ETG (SDSS J0041-0914) appear to require both an extreme dwarf-rich IMF and a high sodium enhancement ([Na/Fe] = +0.4). In addition, lensing constraints on the total mass of the XLENS system within its Einstein radius limit a bottom-heavy IMF with a power-law slope to x <= 3.0 at the 90% CL. We conclude that NaI and TiO features, in comparison with state-of-the-art simple stellar population models, suggest a mildly steepening IMF from Salpeter (dn/dm vprop m -x  with x = 2.35) to x ≈ 3.0 for ETGs in the range sigma = 200-335 km s-1.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the optical spectral region of spectra of ˜1000 stars searching for initial mass function (IMF)-sensitive features to constrain the low-mass end of the IMF slope in elliptical galaxies. The use of indicators bluer than near-infrared features (NaI, CaT, Wing-Ford FeH) is crucial if we want to compare our observations to optical simple stellar population (SSP) models. We use the MILES stellar library (S{\'a}nchez-Bl{\'a}zquez et al.) in the wavelength range 3500-7500 {\AA} to select indices that are sensitive to cool dwarf stars and that do not or only weakly depend on age and metallicity. We find several promising indices of molecular TiO and CaH lines. In this wavelength range, the response of a change in the effective temperature of the cool red giant (RGB) population is similar to the response of a change in the number of dwarf stars in the galaxy. We therefore investigate the degeneracy between IMF variation and DeltaTeff, RGB, and show that it is possible to break this degeneracy with the new IMF indicators defined here. In particular, we define a CaH1 index around lambda6380 {\AA} that arises purely from cool dwarfs, does not strongly depend on age and is anticorrelated with [alpha/Fe]. This index allows the determination of the low-mass end of the IMF slope from integrated-light measurements when combined with different TiO lines and age- and metallicity-dependent features such as Hbeta, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335. The use of several indicators is crucial to break degeneracies between IMF variations, age, abundance pattern and effective temperature of the cool red giant (RGB) population. We measure line-index strengths of our new optical IMF indicators in the Conroy & van Dokkum SSP models and compare these with index strengths of the same spectral features in a sample of stacked Sloan Digital Sky Survey early-type galaxy spectra with varying velocity dispersions. Using different indicators, we find a clear trend of a steepening IMF with increasing velocity dispersion from 150 to 310 km s-1 described by the linear equation x = (2.3 $\pm$ 0.1) log sigma200 + (2.13 $\pm$ 0.15), where x is the IMF slope and sigma200 is the central stellar velocity dispersion measured in units of 200 km s-1. We test the robustness of this relation by repeating the analysis with 10 different sets of indicators. We found that the NaD feature has the largest impact on the IMF slope, if we assume solar [Na/Fe] abundance. By including NaD, the slope of the linear relation increases by 0.3 (2.6 $\pm$ 0.2). We compute the `IMF mismatch' parameter as the ratio of stellar mass-to-light ratio predicted from the x-sigma200 relation to that inferred from SSP models assuming a Salpeter IMF and find good agreement with independent published results.},

@article{Ferreras13,
	Abstract = {An essential component of galaxy formation theory is the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that describes the parent distribution of stellar mass in star-forming regions. We present observational evidence in a sample of early-type galaxies (ETGs) of a tight correlation between central velocity dispersion and the strength of several absorption features sensitive to the presence of low-mass stars. Our sample comprises ˜40 000 ETGs from the Spheroids Panchromatic Investigation in Different Environmental Regions survey (z ≲ 0.1). The data - extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - are combined, rejecting both noisy data, and spectra with contamination from telluric lines, resulting in a set of 18 stacked spectra at high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ≳ 400 {\AA}-1). A combined analysis of IMF-sensitive line strengths and spectral fitting is performed with the latest state-of-the-art population synthesis models (an extended version of the MILES models). A significant trend is found between IMF slope and velocity dispersion, towards an excess of low-mass stars in the most massive galaxies. Although we emphasize that accurate values of the IMF slope will require a detailed analysis of chemical composition (such as [alpha/Fe] or even individual element abundance ratios), the observed trends suggest that low-mass ETGs are better fitted by a Kroupa-like IMF, whereas massive galaxies require bottom-heavy IMFs, exceeding the Salpeter slope at sigma ≳ 200 km s-1.},

@article{Sonnenfeld12,
	Abstract = {Stars and dark matter account for most of the mass of early-type galaxies, but uncertainties in the stellar population and the dark matter profile make it challenging to distinguish between the two components. Nevertheless, precise observations of stellar and dark matter are extremely valuable for testing the many models of structure formation and evolution. We present a measurement of the stellar mass and inner slope of the dark matter halo of a massive early-type galaxy at z = 0.222. The galaxy is the foreground deflector of the double Einstein ring gravitational lens system SDSSJ0946+1006, also known as the "Jackpot." By combining the tools of lensing and dynamics we first constrain the mean slope of the total mass density profile (\rho _{tot}\propto r^{-\gamma ^{\prime }}) within the radius of the outer ring to be gamma' = 1.98 $\pm$ 0.02 $\pm$ 0.01. Then we obtain a bulge-halo decomposition, assuming a power-law form for the dark matter halo. Our analysis yields gammaDM = 1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 for the inner slope of the dark matter profile, in agreement with theoretical findings on the distribution of dark matter in ellipticals, and a stellar mass from lensing and dynamics M LD * = 5.5-1.3 +0.4 × 1011 M &sun;. By comparing this measurement with stellar masses inferred from stellar population synthesis fitting we find that a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) provides a good description of the stellar population of the lens while the probability of the IMF being heavier than Chabrier is 95%. Our data suggest that growth by accretion of small systems from a compact red nugget is a plausible formation scenario for this object.},

	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the mass distribution of stars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for many areas of astrophysics. The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the NaI doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3Msolar (where Msolar is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1Msolar to 1Msolar.},

@article{Kregel05,
	Abstract = {In earlier papers in this series we determined the intrinsic stellar disc kinematics of 15 intermediate- to late-type edge-on spiral galaxies using a dynamical modelling technique. The sample covers a substantial range in maximum rotation velocity and deprojected face-on surface brightness, and contains seven spirals with either a boxy or peanut-shaped bulge. Here we discuss the structural, kinematical and dynamical properties. From the photometry we find that intrinsically more flattened discs tend to have a lower face-on central surface brightness and a larger dynamical mass-to-light ratio. This observation suggests that, at a constant maximum rotational velocity, lower surface brightness discs have smaller vertical stellar velocity dispersions.  Although the individual uncertainties are large, we find from the dynamical modelling that at least 12 discs are submaximal. The average disc contributes 53 +/- 4 per cent to the observed rotation at 2.2 disc scalelengths (hR), with a 1sigma scatter of 15 per cent. This percentage becomes somewhat lower when effects of finite disc flattening and gravity by the dark halo and the gas are taken into account. Since boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are probably associated with bars, the result suggests that at 2.2hR the submaximal nature of discs is independent of barredness. The possibility remains that very high surface brightness discs are maximal, as these discs are underrepresented in our sample. We confirm that the radial stellar disc velocity dispersion is related to the galaxy maximum rotational velocity. The scatter in this sigma versus vmax relation appears to correlate with the disc flattening, face-on central surface brightness and dynamical mass-to-light ratio. Low surface brightness discs tend to be more flattened and have smaller stellar velocity dispersions. The findings are consistent with the observed correlation between disc flattening and dynamical mass-to-light ratio and can generally be reproduced by the simple collapse theory for disc galaxy formation. Finally, the disc mass Tully-Fisher relation is offset from the maximum-disc scaled stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation of the Ursa Major cluster. This offset, -0.3 dex in mass, is naturally explained if the discs of the Ursa Major cluster spirals are submaximal.},

@article{Weiner01,
	Abstract = {We report a dynamical determination of the separate contributions of disk and dark halo masses to the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy. We use fluid-dynamical models of gas flow in the barred galaxy NGC 4123 to constrain the dynamical properties of the galaxy: disk M/L, bar pattern speed, and the central density and scale radius of the dark halo. We derive a realistic barred potential directly from the light distribution. For each model we assume a value of the stellar M/L and a bar pattern speed Omegap and add a dark halo to fit the rotation curve. We then compute the gas flow velocities with a two-dimensional gasdynamical code and compare the model flow patterns to a two-dimensional velocity field derived from Fabry-Perot observations. The strong shocks and noncircular motions in the observed gas flow require a high stellar M/L and a fast-rotating bar. Models with I-band disk M/L of 2.0-2.5 h75, or 80%-100% of the maximum disk value, are highly favored. The corotation radius of the bar must be <=1.5 times the bar semimajor axis. These results contradict some recent claimed ``universal'' galaxy disk/halo relations, since NGC 4123 is of modest size (rotation curve maximum 145 km s-1 and Vflat=130 km s-1) yet quite disk-dominated. The dark halo of NGC 4123 is less concentrated than favored by current models of dark halos based on cosmological simulations. Since some 30% of bright disk galaxies are strongly barred and have dust lanes indicating shock morphology similar to that of NGC 4123, it is likely that they also have high stellar M/L and low-density halos. We suggest that luminous matter dominates inside the optical radius R25 of high surface brightness disk galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the mass-to-light ratios of stellar populations as predicted by stellar population synthesis codes and compare those to dynamical/gravitational measurements. In Bell & de Jong (2001) we showed that population synthesis models predict a tight relation between the color and mass-to-light ratio of a stellar population. The normalization of this relation depends critically on the shape of the stellar IMF at the low-mass end. These faint stars contribute significantly to the mass, but insignificantly to the luminosity and color of a stellar system. In Bell & de Jong (2001) we used rotation curves to normalize the relation, but rotation curves provide only an upper limit to the stellar masses in a system. Here we compare stellar and dynamical masses for a range of stellar systems in order to constrain the mass normalization of stellar population models. We find that the normalization of Bell & de Jong (2001) should be lowered by about 0.05-0.1 dex in M/L. This is consistent with a Kroupa (2001), Chabrier (2003), or a Kennicutt (1983) IMF, but does not leave much room for other unseen components.},

@article{Padmanabhan04,
	Abstract = {We study the variation of the dark matter mass fraction of elliptical galaxies as a function of their luminosity, stellar mass, and size using a sample of 29,469 elliptical galaxies culled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We model ellipticals as a stellar Hernquist profile embedded in an adiabatically compressed dark matter halo. This model allows us to estimate a dynamical mass ( Mdynm) at the half-light radius from the velocity dispersion of the spectra, and to compare these to the stellar mass estimates ( M*) from Kauffmann et al. [MNRAS 341 (2003) 33]. We find that M*/ L is independent of luminosity, while Mdynm/ L increases with luminosity, implying that the dark matter fraction increases with luminosity. We also observe that at a fixed luminosity or stellar mass, the dark matter fraction increases with increasing galaxy size or, equivalently, increases with decreasing surface brightness: high surface brightness galaxies show almost no evidence for dark matter, while in low surface brightness galaxies, the dark matter exceeds the stellar mass at the half-light radius. We relate this to the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, suggesting that the tilt of this plane from simple virial predictions is due to the dark matter in galaxies. We find that a simple model where galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos and have a star formation efficiency independent of their surface brightness explains these trends. We estimate the virial mass of ellipticals as being approximately 7-30 times their stellar mass, with the lower limit suggesting almost all of the gas within the virial radius is converted into stars.},

@article{Zaritsky06,
	Abstract = {We present a unifying empirical description of the structural and kinematic properties of all spheroids embedded in dark matter halos. We find that the intracluster stellar spheroidal components of galaxy clusters, which we call cluster spheroids (CSphs) and which are typically 100 times the size of normal elliptical galaxies, lie on a ``fundamental plane'' as tight as that defined by elliptical galaxies (rms in effective radius of ~0.07) but having a different slope. The slope, as measured by the coefficient of the logsigma term, declines significantly and systematically between the fundamental planes of ellipticals, brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and CSphs. We attribute this decline primarily to a continuous change in Me/Le, the mass-to-light ratio within the effective radius re, with spheroid scale. The magnitude of the slope change requires that it arise principally from differences in the relative distributions of luminous and dark matter, rather than from stellar population differences such as in age and metallicity. By expressing the Me/Le term as a function of sigma in the simple derivation of the fundamental plane and requiring the behavior of that term to mimic the observed nonlinear relationship between logMe/Le and logsigma, we simultaneously fit a two-dimensional manifold to the measured properties of dwarf elliptical and elliptical galaxies, BCGs, and CSphs. The combined data have an rms scatter in logre of 0.114 (0.099 for the combination of ellipticals, BCGs, and CSphs), which is modestly larger than each fundamental plane has alone, but which includes the scatter introduced by merging different studies done in different filters by different investigators. This ``fundamental manifold'' fits the structural and kinematic properties of spheroids that span a factor of 100 in sigma and 1000 in re. While our mathematical form is neither unique nor derived from physical principles, the tightness of the fit leaves little room for improvement by other unification schemes over the range of observed spheroids.},

@article{Gerhard01,
	Abstract = {Based on a uniform dynamical analysis of the line-profile shapes of 21 mostly luminous, slowly rotating, and nearly round elliptical galaxies, we have investigated the dynamical family relations and dark halo properties of ellipticals. Our results include: (i) The circular velocity curves (CVCs) of elliptical galaxies are flat to within ~=10% for R>~0.2Re. (ii) Most ellipticals are moderately radially anisotropic; their dynamical structure is surprisingly uniform. (iii) Elliptical galaxies follow a Tully-Fisher (TF) relation with marginally shallower slope than spiral galaxies, and vmaxc~=300 km s-1 for an L*B galaxy. At given circular velocity, they are ~1 mag fainter in B and ~0.6 mag in R and appear to have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals, even for the maximum M/LB allowed by the kinematics. (iv) The luminosity dependence of M/LB indicated by the tilt of the fundamental plane (FP) is confirmed. The tilt of the FP is not caused by dynamical or photometric nonhomology, although the latter might influence the slope of M/L versus L. It can also not be due only to an increasing dark matter fraction with L for the range of IMF currently discussed. It is, however, consistent with stellar population models based on published metallicities and ages. The main driver is therefore probably metallicity, and a secondary population effect is needed to explain the K-band tilt. (v) These results make it likely that elliptical galaxies have nearly maximal M/LB (minimal halos). (vi) Despite the uniformly flat CVCs, there is a spread in the luminous to dark matter ratio and in cumulative M/LB(r). Some galaxies have no indication for dark matter within 2Re, whereas for others we obtain local M/LB-values of 20-30 at 2Re. (vii) In models with maximum stellar mass, the dark matter contributes ~10%-40% of the mass within Re. Equal interior mass of dark and luminous matter is predicted at ~2-4Re. (viii) Even in these maximum stellar mass models, the halo core densities and phase-space densities are at least ~25 times larger and the halo core radii ~4 times smaller than in spiral galaxies of the same circular velocity. The increase in M/L sets in at ~10 times larger acceleration than in spirals. This could imply that elliptical galaxy halos collapsed at high redshifts or that some of the dark matter in ellipticals might be baryonic.},

	Abstract = {We present a joint gravitational lensing and stellar-dynamical analysis of 15 massive field early-type galaxies selected from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey. The following numerical results are found: (1) A joint likelihood gives an average logarithmic density slope for the total mass density of <gamma'>=2.01+0.02-0.03 (68% CL; rhotot~r-gamma') inside <REinst>=4.2+/-0.4 kpc (rms of 1.6 kpc) for isotropic models. The inferred intrinsic rms spread in logarithmic density slopes is sigmagamma'=0.12. (2) The average position-angle difference between the light distribution and the total mass distribution is found to be <Deltatheta>=0deg+/-3deg (rms of 10$\,^{\circ}$), setting an upper limit of <gammaext><~0.035 on the average external shear. The total mass has an average ellipticity <qSIE>=0.78+/-0.03 (rms of 0.12), which correlates extremely well with the stellar ellipticity, q*, resulting in <qSIE/q*>=0.99+/-0.03 (rms of 0.11) for sigma>~225 km s-1 omitting three S0 lens galaxies. (3) The average projected dark matter mass fraction is inferred to be <fDM>=0.25+/-0.06 (rms of 0.22) inside <REinst>, using the stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from the fundamental plane as priors. (4) Combined with results from the Lenses Structure and Dynamics (LSD) Survey at z>~0.3, we find no significant evolution of the total density slope inside one effective radius for galaxies with sigmaap>=200 km s-1: a linear fit gives alphagamma'≡d<gamma'>/dz=0.23+/-0.16 (1 sigma) for the range z=0.08-1.01. The small scatter and absence of significant evolution in the inner density slopes suggest a collisional scenario in which gas and dark matter strongly couple during galaxy formation, leading to a total mass distribution that rapidly converges to dynamical isothermality.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the initial mass function and mass segregation in super star cluster M82-F with high-resolution Keck NIRSPEC echelle spectroscopy. Cross-correlation with template supergiant spectra provides the velocity dispersion of the cluster, enabling measurement of the kinematic (virial) mass of the cluster when combined with sizes from NICMOS and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images. We find a mass of 6.6+/-0.9×105Msolar based on near-IR light and 7.0+/-1.2×105Msolar based on optical light. Using PSF-fitting photometry, we derive the cluster's light-to-mass (L/M) ratio in both near-IR and optical light and compare to population-synthesis models. The ratios are inconsistent with a normal stellar initial mass function for the adopted age of 40-60 Myr, suggesting a deficiency of low-mass stars within the volume sampled. King model light profile fits to new Hubble Space Telescope ACS images of M82-F, in combination with fits to archival near-IR images, indicate mass segregation in the cluster. As a result, the virial mass represents a lower limit on the mass of the cluster.  Based on observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {I use recent photometric and stellar velocity dispersion measurements of the super-star clusters (SSCs) NGC 1569A and NGC 1705-1 to determine their present-day luminosity/mass ratios (L_V/M). I then use the inferred L_V/M, together with population synthesis models of evolving star clusters, to constrain the initial mass functions (IMFs) in these objects. I find that (L_V/M)_&sun; = 28.9 in 1569A and (L_V/M)_&sun; = 126 in 1705-1. It follows that in 1569A the IMF is steep with alpha ~ 2.5 for m^-alphadm IMFs that extend to 0.1 M_&sun;. This implies that most of the stellar mass in 1569A is contained in low-mass (<1 M_&sun;) stars; however, in 1705-1 the IMF is either flat, with alpha <~ 2, or it is truncated at a lower mass limit between 1 and 3 M_&sun;. I compare the inferred IMFs with the mass functions (MFs) of Galactic globular clusters. It appears that 1569A has a sufficient reservoir of low-mass stars for it plausibly to evolve into an object similar to Galactic globular clusters; however, the apparent deficiency of low-mass stars in 1705-1 may make it difficult for this SSC to become a globular cluster. If low-mass stars do dominate the cluster mass in 1705-1, the large L_V/M in this SSC may be evidence that the most massive stars have formed close to the cluster cores.},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than ˜100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than ˜104M&sun;; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

@article{Smith01,
	Abstract = {We present high-dispersion echelle spectroscopy of the very luminous, young super star cluster (SSC) `F' in M82, obtained with the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope, for the purpose of deriving its dynamical mass and assessing whether it will survive to become an old globular cluster. In addition to the stellar lines, the spectrum contains complex Nai absorption and broad emission lines from the ionized gas. We measure a stellar velocity dispersion of 13.4+/-0.7kms-1 and a projected half-light radius of 2.8+/-0.3pc from archival HST/WFPC2 images, and derive a dynamical mass of 1.2+/-0.1×106Msolar, demonstrating that M82-F is a very massive, compact cluster. We determine that the current luminosity-to-mass ratio (LV/M)solar for M82-F is 45+/-13. Comparison with spectral synthesis models shows that (LV/M)solar is a factor of ~5 higher than that predicted for a standard Kroupa initial mass function (IMF) at the well-determined age for M82-F of 60+/-20Myr. This high value of (LV/M)solar indicates a deficit of low-mass stars in M82-F; the current mass function (MF) evidently is `top-heavy'. We find that a lower mass cut-off of 2-3Msolar is required to match the observations for a MF with a slope alpha=2.3. Since the cluster apparently lacks long-lived low-mass stars, it will not become an old globular cluster, but probably will dissolve at an age of <= 2Gyr. We also derive updated luminosity-to-mass ratios for the younger SSCs NGC 1569A and 1705-1. For the first object, the observations are consistent with a slightly steeper MF (alpha=2.5), whereas for NGC 1705-1 the observed ratio requires the MF to be truncated near 2Msolar for a slope of alpha=2.3. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of large-scale IMF variations; with the present data the top-heavy MF could reflect a local mass segregation effect during the birth of the cluster. M82-F probably formed in a dense molecular cloud; however, its high radial velocity with respect to the centre of M82 (~-175kms-1) suggests that it is on an eccentric orbit and now far from its birthplace, so the environment of its formation is unknown.},

@article{Wolf10,
	Abstract = {We derive an accurate mass estimator for dispersion-supported stellar systems and demonstrate its validity by analysing resolved line-of-sight velocity data for globular clusters, dwarf galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Specifically, by manipulating the spherical Jeans equation we show that the mass enclosed within the 3D deprojected half-light radius r1/2 can be determined with only mild assumptions about the spatial variation of the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy as long as the projected velocity dispersion profile is fairly flat near the half-light radius, as is typically observed. We find M1/2 = 3 G-1< sigma2los > r1/2 ~= 4 G-1< sigma2los > Re, where < sigma2los > is the luminosity-weighted square of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and Re is the 2D projected half-light radius. While deceptively familiar in form, this formula is not the virial theorem, which cannot be used to determine accurate masses unless the radial profile of the total mass is known a priori. We utilize this finding to show that all of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (MW dSphs) are consistent with having formed within a halo of a mass of approximately 3 × 109 Msolar, assuming a Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. The faintest MW dSphs seem to have formed in dark matter haloes that are at least as massive as those of the brightest MW dSphs, despite the almost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity between them. We expand our analysis to the full range of observed dispersion-supported stellar systems and examine their dynamical I-band mass-to-light ratios UpsilonI1/2. The UpsilonI1/2 versus M1/2 relation for dispersion-supported galaxies follows a U shape, with a broad minimum near UpsilonI1/2 ~= 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal ellipticals, a steep rise to UpsilonI1/2 ~= 3200 for ultra-faint dSphs and a more shallow rise to UpsilonI1/2 ~= 800 for galaxy cluster spheroids.},

@article{Trujillo04,
	Abstract = {The variation of the mass-to-light M/L ratios of early-type galaxies as a function of their luminosities L is investigated. It is shown that the tilt beta=0.27 (in the B band) of the fundamental plane relation M/L~Lbeta can be understood as a combination of two effects: about one-quarter (i.e., Deltabeta=0.07) is a result of systematic variations of the stellar population properties with increasing luminosity. The remaining three-quarters (i.e., Deltabeta=0.2) can be completely attributed to nonhomology effects that lead to a systematic change of the surface brightness profiles with increasing luminosity. Consequently, the observed tilt in the K band (beta=0.17), where stellar population effects are negligible, is explained by nonhomology effects alone. After correcting for nonhomology, the mean value of the mass-to-light ratio of elliptical galaxies (M/LB) is 7.1+/-2.8 (1 sigma scatter).},

The principal goal of stellar population synthesis (SPS) is to extract these variables from observed SEDs. In this review I provide an overview of the SPS technique and discuss what can be reliably measured from galaxy SEDs. Topics include stellar masses, star-formation rates and histories, metallicities and abundance patterns, dust properties, and the stellar initial mass function.},

@article{Dutton13,
	Abstract = {Recent work has suggested that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is not universal, but rather is correlated with galaxy stellar mass, stellar velocity dispersion or morphological type. In this paper, we investigate variations of the IMF within individual galaxies. For this purpose, we use strong lensing and gas kinematics to measure independently the normalization of the IMF of the bulge and disc components of a sample of five massive spiral galaxies with substantial bulge components taken from the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS). We find that the stellar masses of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic data. A comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis models fitted to optical and near-infrared photometry favours a Salpeter-like normalization of the IMF. Conversely, the disc masses are less well constrained due to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with Milky Way-type IMFs in agreement with previous studies. The discs are submaximal at 2.2 disc scale lengths, but due to the contribution of the bulges, the galaxies are baryon dominated at 2.2 disc scale lengths. Globally, our inferred IMF normalization is consistent with that found for early-type galaxies of comparable stellar mass (>1011 M&sun;). Our results suggest a non-universal IMF within the different components of spiral galaxies, adding to the well-known differences in stellar populations between discs and bulges.},

	Abstract = {Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) represents a phenomenological alternative to dark matter (DM) for the missing mass problem in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. We analyse the central regions of a local sample of ˜220 early-type galaxies from the ATLAS3D survey, to see if the data can be reproduced without recourse to DM. We estimate dynamical masses in the MOND context through Jeans analysis and compare to ATLAS3D stellar masses from stellar population synthesis. We find that the observed stellar mass-velocity dispersion relation is steeper than expected assuming MOND with a fixed stellar initial mass function (IMF) and a standard value for the acceleration parameter a0. Turning from the space of observables to model space (a) fixing the IMF, a universal value for a0 cannot be fitted, while, (b) fixing a0 and leaving the IMF free to vary, we find that it is `lighter' (Chabrier like) for low-dispersion galaxies and `heavier' (Salpeter like) for high dispersions. This MOND-based trend matches inferences from Newtonian dynamics with DM and from the detailed analysis of spectral absorption lines, adding to the converging lines of evidence for a systematically varying IMF.},

	Abstract = {We present an F606W-F814W color-magnitude diagram for the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy based on HST Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) images. The luminosity function is well sampled to 3 mag below the turnoff. We see no evidence for multiple turnoffs and conclude that, at least over the field of view of the WFPC2, star formation was primarily single-epoch. If the observed number of blue stragglers is due to extended star formation, then roughly 6 percent (upper limit) of the stars could be half as old as the bulk of the galaxy. The color difference between the red giant branch and the turnoff is consistent with an old population and is very similar to that observed in the old, metal-poor Galactic globular clusters M68 and M92. Despite its red horizontal branch, Draco appears to be older than M68 and M92 by 1.6 +/- 2.5 Gyr, lending support to the argument that the 'second parameter' that governs horizontal-branch morphology must be something other than age. Draco's observed luminosity function is very similar to that of M68, and the derived initial mass function is consistent with that of the solar neighborhood.},

@article{Kalirai13,
	Abstract = {We present a new measurement of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) based on ultra-deep, high-resolution photometry of >5000 stars in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys observations reveal this rich, cospatial population behind the foreground globular cluster 47 Tuc, which we targeted for 121 HST orbits. The stellar main sequence of the SMC is measured in the F606W, F814W color-magnitude diagram down to ~30th magnitude, and is cleanly separated from the foreground star cluster population using proper motions. We simulate the SMC population by extracting stellar masses (single and unresolved binaries) from specific IMFs and converting those masses to luminosities in our bandpasses. The corresponding photometry for these simulated stars is drawn directly from a rich cloud of 4 million artificial stars, thereby accounting for the real photometric scatter and completeness of the data. Over a continuous and well-populated mass range of M = 0.37-0.93 M &sun; (e.g., down to a ~75% completeness limit at F606W = 28.7), we demonstrate that the IMF is well represented by a single power-law form with slope alpha = -1.90 (+0.15 -0.10) (3sigma error) (e.g., dN/dMvprop M alpha). This is shallower than the Salpeter slope of alpha = -2.35, which agrees with the observed stellar luminosity function at higher masses. Our results indicate that the IMF does not turn over to a more shallow power-law form within this mass range. We discuss implications of this result for the theory of star formation, the inferred masses of galaxies, and the (lack of a) variation of the IMF with metallicity.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with proposal GO-11677.},

	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function at high redshift is an important defining property of the first stellar systems to form and may also play a role in various dark matter problems. We here determine the faint stellar luminosity function in an apparently dark-matter-dominated external galaxy in which the stars formed at high redshift. The Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is a system with a particularly simple stellar population---all of the stars being old and metal-poor---similar to that of a classical halo globular cluster. A direct comparison of the faint luminosity functions of the UMi dSph and of similar metallicity, old globular clusters is equivalent to a comparison of the initial mass functions and is presented here, based on deep HST WFPC2 and STIS imaging data. We find that these luminosity functions are indistinguishable, down to a luminosity corresponding to ˜0.3 M &sun;. Our results show that the low-mass stellar IMF for stars that formed at very high redshift is apparently invariant across environments as diverse as those of an extremely low-surface-brightness, dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy and a dark-matter-free, high-density globular cluster within the Milky Way.},

@article{Espinoza09,
	Abstract = {The massive Arches cluster near the Galactic center should be an ideal laboratory for investigating massive star formation under extreme conditions. But it comes at a high price: the cluster is hidden behind several tens of magnitudes of visual extinction. Severe crowding requires space or AO-assisted instruments to resolve the stellar populations, and even with the best instruments interpreting the data is far from direct. Several investigations using NICMOS and the most advanced AO imagers on the ground revealed an overall top-heavy IMF for the cluster, with a very flat IMF near the center. There are several effects, however, that could potentially bias these results, in particular the strong differential extinction and the problem of transforming the observations into a standard photometric system in the presence of strong reddening. We present new observations obtained with the NAOS-Conica (NACO) AO-imager on the VLT. The problem of photometric transformation is avoided by working in the natural photometric system of NACO, and we use a Bayesian approach to determine masses and reddenings from the broad-band IR colors. A global value of Gamma = -1.1 $\pm$ 0.2 for the high-mass end (M > 10 M&sun;) of the IMF is obtained, and we conclude that a power law of Salpeter slope cannot be discarded for the Arches cluster. The flattening of the IMF towards the center is confirmed, but is less severe than previously thought. We find Gamma = -0.88 $\pm$ 0.20, which is incompatible with previous determinations.

	Abstract = {Accurate luminosity functions (LFs) for a dozen globular clusters have now been measured at or just beyond their half-light radius using HST. They span almost the entire cluster main sequence (MS) below 0.75 Msolar. All these clusters exhibit LFs that rise continuously from an absolute I magnitude MI~=6 to a peak at MI~=8.5-9 and then drop with increasing MI. Transformation of the LFs into mass functions (MFs) by means of mass-luminosity (ML) relations that are consistent with all presently available data on the physical properties of low-mass, low-metallicity stars shows that all the LFs observed so far can be obtained from MFs having the shape of a lognormal distribution with characteristic mass mc=0.33+/-0.03 Msolar and standard deviation sigma=0.34+/-0.04. In particular, the LFs of the four clusters in the sample that extend well beyond the peak luminosity down to close to the hydrogen-burning limit (NGC 6341, NGC 6397, NGC 6752, and NGC 6809) can only be reproduced by such distributions and not by a single power law in the 0.1-0.6 Msolar range. After correction for the effects of mass segregation, the variation of the ratio of the number of higher to lower mass stars with cluster mass or any simple orbital parameter or the expected time to disruption recently computed for these clusters shows no statistically significant trend over a range of this last parameter of more than a factor of ~100. We conclude that the global MFs of these clusters have not been measurably modified by evaporation and tidal interactions with the Galaxy and, thus, should reflect the initial distribution of stellar masses. Since the lognormal function that we find is also very similar to the one obtained independently for much younger clusters and to the form expected theoretically, the implication seems to be unavoidable that it represents the true stellar initial mass function for this type of star in this mass range. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We present results of a photometric survey whose aim was to derive structural and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy, it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow for simple statistical considerations. Methods: BV wide-field CCD photometry was obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. Results: This study reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42 observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate. The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is 3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log({age}) = 8. Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log({age}) = 8.5 and not younger than one relaxation time.  Tables 1-5 are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We present wide-field deep {UBVI} photometry for the previously unstudied open cluster NGC 4852 down to a limiting magnitude I˜24, obtained from observations taken with the Wide Field Imager camera on-board the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope at La Silla (ESO, Chile). These data are used to obtain the first estimate of the cluster basic parameters, to study the cluster spatial extension by means of star counts, and to derive the Luminosity (LF) and Mass Function (MF). The cluster radius turns out to be 5.0$\pm$1.0 arcmin. The cluster emerges clearly from the field down to V=20 mag. At fainter magnitudes, it is completely confused with the general Galactic disk field. The stars inside this region define a young open cluster (200 million years old) 1.1 kpc far from the Sun (m-M = 11.60, E(B-V) = 0.45). The Present Day Mass Functions (PDMF) from the V photometry is one of the most extended in mass obtained to date, and can be represented as a power-law with a slope alpha = 2.3$\pm$0.3 and (the Salpeter MF in this notation has a slope alpha = 2.35), in the mass range 3.2 <= {m}/{m&sun;} <= 0.6. Below this mass, the MF cannot be considered as representative of the cluster MF, as the cluster merges with the field and therefore the MF is the result of the combined effect of strong irregularities in the stellar background and interaction of the cluster with the dense Galactic field. The cluster total mass at the limiting magnitude results to be 2570$\pm$210  M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {We measure the stellar mass surface densities of early type galaxies by observing the micro-lensing of macro-lensed quasars caused by individual stars, including stellar remnants, brown dwarfs and red dwarfs too faint to produce photometric or spectroscopic signatures. Instead of observing multiple micro-lensing events in a single system, we combine single epoch X-ray snapshots of ten quadruple systems, and compare the measured relative magnifications for the images with those computed from macro-models. We use these to normalize a stellar mass fundamental plane constructed using a Salpeter IMF with a low mass cutoff of 0.1 solar mass and treat the zeropoint of the surface mass density as a free parameter. Our method measures the graininess of the gravitational potential produced by individual stars, in contrast to methods that decompose a smooth total gravitational potential into two smooth components, one stellar and one dark. We find the median likelihood value for the normalization factor F by which the Salpeter stellar masses must be multiplied is 1.52, with a one sigma confidence range, dominated by small number statistics, of 0.92 < F < 2.50.},

	Abstract = {The spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth of information regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history, and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population. Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1 mum and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features Na I, Ca II, and FeH at 0.82 mum, 0.86 mum, and 0.99 mum, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals <~ 1%. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L)stars, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way (MW) IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L)stars values do not exceed dynamically based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L)stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a MW IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

	Abstract = {We present orbit-based dynamical models and stellar population analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey J151741.75-004217.6, a low-redshift (z = 0.116) early-type galaxy (ETG) which, for its moderate luminosity, has an exceptionally high velocity dispersion. We aim to determine the central black hole (BH) mass (M*), the i-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (Upsilon*, i) and the slope of the initial mass function (IMF). Combining constraints from Hubble Space Telescope imaging and long-slit kinematic data with those from fitting the spectrum with stellar populations models of varying IMFs, we show that this galaxy has a large fraction of low-mass stars, significantly higher than implied even by a Salpeter IMF. We exclude a Chabrier/Kroupa as well as a unimodal (i.e. single-segment) IMF, while a bimodal (low-mass tapered) shape is consistent with the dynamical constraints. Thereby, our study demonstrates that a very bottom-heavy IMF can exist even in an L* ETG. We place an upper limit of 1010.5 M&sun; on M*, which still leaves open the possibility of an extremely massive BH.},

	Abstract = {In the companion Paper XV of this series, we derive accurate total mass-to-light ratios (M/L)_JAM≈ (M/L)({r}= {R_e}) within a sphere of radius r= {R_e} centred on the galaxy, as well as stellar (M/L)stars (with the dark matter removed) for the volume-limited and nearly mass-selected (stellar mass M_star ≳ 6× 10^9 { M_{&sun;}}) ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs, ellipticals Es and lenticulars S0s). Here, we use those parameters to study the two orthogonal projections ({M_JAM}, {sigma _e}) and ({M_JAM}, {R_e^maj}) of the thin Mass Plane (MP) ({M_JAM}, {sigma _e}, {R_e^maj}) which describes the distribution of the galaxy population, where {M_JAM}≡ L× (M/L)_JAM≈ M_star. The distribution of galaxy properties on both projections of the MP is characterized by: (i) the same zone of exclusion (ZOE), which can be transformed from one projection to the other using the scalar virial equation. The ZOE is roughly described by two power laws, joined by a break at a characteristic mass {M_JAM}≈ 3× 10^{10} { M_{&sun;}}, which corresponds to the minimum Re and maximum stellar density. This results in a break in the mean {M_JAM}-{sigma _e} relation with trends {M_JAM}∝ sigma _e^{2.3} and {M_JAM}∝ sigma _e^{4.7} at small and large sigmae, respectively; (ii) a characteristic mass {M_JAM}≈ 2× 10^{11} { M_{&sun;}} which separates a population dominated by flat fast rotator with discs and spiral galaxies at lower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses; (iii) below that mass the distribution of ETGs' properties on the two projections of the MP tends to be constant along lines of roughly constant sigmae, or equivalently along lines with {R_e^maj}∝ {M_JAM}, respectively (or even better parallel to the ZOE: {R_e^maj}∝ M_JAM^{0.75}); (iv) it forms a continuous and parallel sequence with the distribution of spiral galaxies; (v) at even lower masses, the distribution of fast-rotator ETGs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf ETGs (Sph) and dwarf irregulars (Im), respectively.  We use dynamical models to analyse our kinematic maps. We show that sigmae traces the bulge fraction, which appears to be the main driver for the observed trends in the dynamical (M/L)JAM and in indicators of the (M/L)pop of the stellar population like Hbeta and colour, as well as in the molecular gas fraction. A similar variation along contours of sigmae is also observed for the mass normalization of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which was recently shown to vary systematically within the ETGs' population. Our preferred relation has the form log _{10} [(M/L)_stars/(M/L)_Salp]=a+b× log _{10}({sigma _e}/130 {km s^{-1}}) with a = -0.12 $\pm$ 0.01 and b = 0.35 $\pm$ 0.06. Unless there are major flaws in all stellar population models, this trend implies a transition of the mean IMF from Kroupa to Salpeter in the interval log _{10}({sigma _e}/{km s}^{-1})≈ 1.9-2.5 (or {sigma _e}≈ 90-290 km s-1), with a smooth variation in between, consistently with what was shown in Cappellari et al. The observed distribution of galaxy properties on the MP provides a clean and novel view for a number of previously reported trends, which constitute special two-dimensional projections of the more general four-dimensional parameters trends on the MP. We interpret it as due to a combination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction, which increases sigmae, decreases Re, and greatly enhance the likelihood for a galaxy to have its star formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass and Re by moving galaxies along lines of roughly constant sigmae (or steeper), while leaving the population nearly unchanged.},

	Abstract = {We construct axisymmetric and triaxial galaxy models with a phase-space distribution function that depends on linear combinations of the three exact integrals of motion for a separable potential. These Abel models, first introduced by Dejonghe & Laurent and subsequently extended by Mathieu & Dejonghe, are the axisymmetric and triaxial generalizations of the well-known spherical Osipkov-Merritt models. We show that the density and higher order velocity moments, as well as the line-of-sight velocity distribution of these models can be calculated efficiently and that they capture much of the rich internal dynamics of early-type galaxies. We build a triaxial and oblate axisymmetric galaxy model with projected kinematics that mimic the two-dimensional kinematic observations that are obtained with integral-field spectrographs such as SAURON. We fit the simulated observations with axisymmetric and triaxial dynamical models constructed with our numerical implementation of Schwarzschild orbit-superposition method. We find that Schwarzschild method is able to recover the internal dynamics and three-integral distribution function of realistic models of early-type galaxies.},

@article{Cappellari07,
	Abstract = {We analyse the orbital distribution of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies using SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics within about one effective (half-light) radius. We construct the anisotropy diagram, which relates the ratio of the ordered and random motion in a galaxy (V/sigma) to its observed ellipticity (ε), for the 48 E/S0 galaxies from the SAURON survey. For a subsample of 24 galaxies consistent with axisymmetry, we use three-integral axisymmetric Schwarzschild dynamical models to recover the detailed orbital distribution, and we find good agreement with the anisotropy derived from the (V/sigma, ε) diagram. In a companion paper (Paper IX), we show that the early-type galaxies can be subdivided into two classes of systems with or without a significant amount of specific stellar angular momentum. Here, we show that the two classes have different distributions on the (V/sigma, ε) diagram. The slow rotators are more common among the most massive systems and are generally classified as E from photometry alone. Those in our sample tend to be fairly round (ε <~ 0.3), but can have significant kinematical misalignments, indicating that as a class they are moderately triaxial, and span a range of anisotropies (delta <~ 0.3). The fast rotators are generally fainter and are classified as either E or S0. They can appear quite flattened (ε <~ 0.7), do not show significant kinematical misalignments (unless barred or interacting), indicating they are nearly axisymmetric and span an even larger range of anisotropies (delta <~ 0.5). These results are confirmed when we extend our analysis to 18 additional E/S0 galaxies observed with SAURON. The dynamical models indicate that the anisotropy inferred from the (V/sigma, ε) diagram is due to a flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane (sigmaR > sigmaz), which we quantify with the beta anisotropy parameter. We find a trend of increasing beta for intrinsically flatter galaxies. A number of the fast rotators show evidence for containing a flattened, kinematically distinct component, which in some cases counter-rotates relative to the main galaxy body. These components are generally more metal rich than the galaxy body. All these results support the idea that fast rotators are nearly oblate and contain disc-like components. The role of gas must have been important for their formation. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial. Current collisionless merger models seem unable to explain their detailed observed properties.},

@article{Chabrier03,
	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

@article{Shetty14,
	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a key parameter for studying galaxy evolution. Here we measure the IMF mass normalization for a sample of 68 field galaxies in the redshift range 0.7-0.9 within the Extended Groth Strip. To do this we derive the total (stellar + dark matter) mass-to-light [(M/L)] ratio using axisymmetric dynamical models. Within the region where we have kinematics (about one half-light radius), the models assume (1) that mass follows light, implying negligible differences between the slope of the stellar and total density profiles, (2) constant velocity anisotropy (\beta _{z}\equiv 1-\sigma _z^2/\sigma _R^2=0.2), and (3) that galaxies are seen at the average inclination for random orientations (i.e., i = 60$\,^{\circ}$, where i = 90$\,^{\circ}$ represents edge-on). The dynamical models are based on anisotropic Jeans equations, constrained by Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging and the central velocity dispersion of the galaxies, extracted from good-quality spectra taken by the DEEP2 survey. The population (M/L) are derived from full-spectrum fitting of the same spectra with a grid of simple stellar population models. Recent dynamical modeling results from the ATLAS3D project and numerical simulations of galaxy evolution indicate that the dark matter fraction within the central regions of our galaxies should be small. This suggests that our derived total (M/L) should closely approximate the stellar M/L. Our comparison of the dynamical (M/L) and the population (M/L) then implies that for galaxies with stellar mass M * >~ 1011 M ☉, the average normalization of the IMF is consistent with a Salpeter slope, with a substantial scatter. This is similar to what is found within a similar mass range for nearby galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present the metallicity results from the ARGOS spectroscopic survey of the Galactic bulge. Our aim is to understand the formation of the Galactic bulge: did it form via mergers, as expected from Lambda cold dark matter theory, or from disc instabilities, as suggested by its boxy/peanut shape, or both? Our stars are mostly red clump giants, which have a well-defined absolute magnitude from which distances can be determined. We have obtained spectra for 28 000 stars at a spectral resolution of R = 11 000. From these spectra, we have determined stellar parameters and distances to an accuracy of <1.5 kpc. The stars in the inner Galaxy span a large range in [Fe/H], -2.8 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.6. From the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as a function of [Fe/H], we propose that the stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5 are part of the boxy/peanut bar/bulge. We associate the lower metallicity stars ([Fe/H] < -0.5) with the thick disc, which may be puffed up in the inner region, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disc and inner halo. For the bulge stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5, we find two discrete populations: (i) stars with [Fe/H] ≈ -0.25 which provide a roughly constant fraction of the stars in the latitude interval b = -5$\,^{\circ}$ to -10$\,^{\circ}$, and (ii) a kinematically colder, more metal-rich population with mean [Fe/H] ≈ +0.15 which is more prominent closer to the plane. The changing ratio of these components with latitude appears as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. We attribute both of these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation from the thin disc. We associate the thicker component with the stars of the early less metal-rich thin disc, and associate the more metal-rich population concentrated to the plane with the colder more metal-rich stars of the early thin disc, similar to the colder and younger more metal-rich stars seen in the thin disc in the solar neighbourhood today. We do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generated bulge component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulge stars with such a classical bulge component. The clear spatial and kinematic separation of the two bulge populations (i) and (ii) makes it unlikely that any significant merger event could have affected the inner regions of the Galaxy since the time when the bulge-forming instabilities occurred.},

	Abstract = {Near the minor axis of the Galactic bulge, at latitudes b < -5$\,^{\circ}$, the red giant clump stars are split into two components along the line of sight. We investigate this split using the three fields from the ARGOS survey that lie on the minor axis at (l, b) = (0$\,^{\circ}$, -5$\,^{\circ}$), (0$\,^{\circ}$, -7fdg5), (0$\,^{\circ}$, -10$\,^{\circ}$). The separation is evident for stars with [Fe/H] > - 0.5 in the two higher-latitude fields, but not in the field at b = -5$\,^{\circ}$. Stars with [Fe/H] < - 0.5 do not show the split. We compare the spatial distribution and kinematics of the clump stars with predictions from an evolutionary N-body model of a bulge that grew from a disk via bar-related instabilities. The density distribution of the peanut-shaped model is depressed near its minor axis. This produces a bimodal distribution of stars along the line of sight through the bulge near its minor axis, very much as seen in our observations. The observed and modeled kinematics of the two groups of stars are also similar. We conclude that the split red clump of the bulge is probably a generic feature of boxy/peanut bulges that grew from disks, and that the disk from which the bulge grew had relatively few stars with [Fe/H] < - 0.5.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the Making Galaxies In a Cosmological Context (MAGICC) programme of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We describe a parameter study of galaxy formation simulations of an L* galaxy that uses early stellar feedback combined with supernova feedback to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. While supernova feedback alone can reduce star formation enough to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship, the galaxy forms too many stars before z = 2 to match the evolution seen using abundance matching. Our early stellar feedback is purely thermal and thus operates like an ultraviolet ionization source as well as providing some additional pressure from the radiation of massive, young stars. The early feedback heats gas to >106 K before cooling it to 104 K. The pressure from this hot gas creates a more extended disc and prevents more star formation prior to z = 1 than supernova feedback alone. The resulting disc galaxy has a flat rotation curve, an exponential surface brightness profile, and matches a wide range of disc scaling relationships. The disc forms from the inside-out with an increasing exponential scale length as the galaxy evolves. Overall, early stellar feedback helps to simulate galaxies that match observational results at low and high redshifts.},

@article{Obreja13,
	Abstract = {We analyze and compare the bulges of a sample of L * spiral galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations in a cosmological context, using two different codes, P-DEVA and GASOLINE. The codes regulate star formation in very different ways, with P-DEVA simulations inputting low star formation efficiency under the assumption that feedback occurs on subgrid scales, while the GASOLINE simulations have feedback that drives large-scale outflows. In all cases, the marked knee shape in mass aggregation tracks, corresponding to the transition from an early phase of rapid mass assembly to a later slower one, separates the properties of two populations within the simulated bulges. The bulges analyzed show an important early starburst resulting from the collapse-like fast phase of mass assembly, followed by a second phase with lower star formation, driven by a variety of processes such as disk instabilities and/or mergers. Classifying bulge stellar particles identified at z = 0 into old and young according to these two phases, we found bulge stellar sub-populations with distinct kinematics, shapes, stellar ages, and metal contents. The young components are more oblate, generally smaller, more rotationally supported, with higher metallicity and less alpha-element enhanced than the old ones. These results are consistent with the current observational status of bulges, and provide an explanation for some apparently paradoxical observations, such as bulge rejuvenation and metal-content gradients observed. Our results suggest that bulges of L * galaxies will generically have two bulge populations that can be likened to classical and pseudo-bulges, with differences being in the relative proportions of the two, which may vary due to galaxy mass and specific mass accretion and merger histories.},

	Abstract = {Within a fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we form a galaxy which rotates at 140 km s-1, and it is characterized by two loose spiral arms and a bar, indicative of a Hubble-type SBc/d galaxy. We show that our simulated galaxy has no classical bulge, with a pure disc profile at z = 1, well after the major merging activity has ended. A long-lived bar subsequently forms, resulting in the formation of a secularly formed 'pseudo-'bulge, with the final bulge-to-total light ratio of 0.21. We show that the majority of gas which loses angular momentum and falls to the central region of the galaxy during the merging epoch is blown back into the hot halo, with much of it returning later to form stars in the disc. We propose that this mechanism of redistribution of angular momentum via a galactic fountain, when coupled with the results from our previous study which showed why gas outflows are biased to have low angular momentum, can solve the angular momentum/bulgeless disc problem of the cold dark matter paradigm.},

	Abstract = {Recent data from the VVV survey have strengthened evidence for a structural change in the Galactic bulge inward of |l| <= 4$\,^{\circ}$. Here we show with an N-body barred galaxy simulation that a boxy bulge formed through the bar and buckling instabilities effortlessly matches measured bulge longitude profiles for red clump stars. The same simulation snapshot was earlier used to clarify the apparent boxy bulge---long bar dichotomy, for the same orientation and scaling. The change in the slope of the model longitude profiles in the inner few degrees is caused by a transition from highly elongated to more nearly axisymmetric isodensity contours in the inner boxy bulge. This transition is confined to a few degrees from the Galactic plane; thus the change of slope is predicted to disappear at higher Galactic latitudes. We also show that the nuclear star count map derived from this simulation snapshot displays a longitudinal asymmetry similar to that observed in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) data, but is less flattened to the Galactic plane than the 2MASS map. These results support the interpretation that the Galactic bulge originated from disk evolution and question the evidence advanced from star count data for the existence of a secondary nuclear bar in the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {Secular evolution is one of the key routes through which galaxies evolve along the Hubble sequence. Not only does the disc undergo morphological and kinematic changes, but a pre-existing classical bulge may also be dynamically changed by the secular processes driven primarily by the bar. We study the influence of a growing bar on the dynamical evolution of a low-mass classical bulge that might be present in galaxies like the Milky Way. Using self-consistent high-resolution N-body simulations, we study how an initially isotropic non-rotating small classical bulge absorbs angular momentum emitted by the bar. The basic mechanism of this angular momentum exchange is through resonances and a considerable fraction of the angular momentum is channelled through Lagrange point (-1:1) and inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) (2:1) orbits. In the phase of rapid dynamical growth, retrograde non-resonant orbits also absorb significant angular momentum. As a result of this angular momentum gain, the initially non-rotating classical bulge transforms into a fast rotating, radially anisotropic and triaxial object, embedded in the similarly fast rotating boxy bulge formed from the disc. Towards the end of the evolution, the classical bulge develops cylindrical rotation. By that time, its inner regions host a 'classical bulge-bar' whose distinct kinematics could serve as direct observational evidence for the secular evolution in the galaxy. Implications of these results are discussed in brief.},

In the far future, evolution will mostly be secular the slow rearrangement of energy and mass that results from interactions involving collective phenomena such as bars, oval disks, spiral structure, and triaxial dark halos. Both processes are important now. This review discusses internal secular evolution, concentrating on one important consequence, the buildup of dense central components in disk galaxies that look like classical, merger-built bulges but that were made slowly out of disk gas.

@article{Shen10,
	Abstract = {Bulges are commonly believed to form in the dynamical violence of galaxy collisions and mergers. Here, we model the stellar kinematics of the Bulge Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA) and find no sign that the Milky Way contains a classical bulge formed by scrambling pre-existing disks of stars in major mergers. Rather, the bulge appears to be a bar seen somewhat end-on, as hinted from its asymmetric boxy shape. We construct a simple but realistic N-body model of the Galaxy that self-consistently develops a bar. The bar immediately buckles and thickens in the vertical direction. As seen from the Sun, the result resembles the boxy bulge of our Galaxy. The model fits the BRAVA stellar kinematic data covering the whole bulge strikingly well with no need for a merger-made classical bulge. The bar in our best-fit model has a half-length of ~4 kpc and extends 20$\,^{\circ}$ from the Sun-Galactic center line. We use the new kinematic constraints to show that any classical bulge contribution cannot be larger than ~8% of the disk mass. Thus, the Galactic bulge is a part of the disk and not a separate component made in a prior merger. Giant, pure-disk galaxies like our own present a major challenge to the standard picture in which galaxy formation is dominated by hierarchical clustering and galaxy mergers.},

	Abstract = {The color-magnitude diagrams of ~7 x 105 stars obtained for 12 fields across the Galactic bulge with the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment project reveal a well-defined population of bulge red clump giants. We find that the distributions of the apparent magnitudes of the red clump stars are systematically fainter when observing toward lower Galactic l fields. The most plausible explanation for this distinct trend is that the Galactic bulge is a bar whose nearest end lies at positive Galactic longitude. We model this Galactic bar by fitting the observed luminosity functions in the red clump region of the color-magnitude diagram for all fields. We find that, almost regardless of the analytical function used to describe the three-dimensional distribution of stars in the Galactic bar, the resulting models have the major axis inclined to the line of sight from 20 deg to 30 deg, with axis ratios corresponding to x0:y0:z0 = 3.5:1.5:1. This puts a strong constraint on the possible range of the Galactic bar models.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We determine the iron distribution function (IDF) for bulge field stars, in three different fields along the Galactic minor axis and at latitudes b = -4$\,^{\circ}$, b = -6$\,^{\circ}$, and b = -12$\,^{\circ}$. A fourth field including NGC 6553 is also included in the discussion.  Methods: About 800 bulge field K giants were observed with the GIRAFFE spectrograph of FLAMES@VLT at spectral resolution R ~ 20 000. Several of them were observed again with UVES at R ~ 45 000 to insure the accuracy of the measurements. The LTE abundance analysis yielded stellar parameters and iron abundances that allowed us to construct an IDF for the bulge that, for the first time, is based on high-resolution spectroscopy for each individual star.  Results: The IDF derived here is centered on solar metallicity, and extends from [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 to [Fe/H] ~ +0.5. The distribution is asymmetric, with a sharper cutoff on the high-metallicity side, and it is narrower than previously measured. A variation in the mean metallicity along the bulge minor axis is clearly between b = -4$\,^{\circ}$ and b = -6$\,^{\circ}$ ([Fe/H] decreasing ~ by 0.6 dex per kpc). The field at b = -12$\,^{\circ}$ is consistent with the presence of a gradient, but its quantification is complicated by the higher disk/bulge fraction in this field.  Conclusions: Our findings support a scenario in which both infall and outflow were important during the bulge formation, and then suggest the presence of a radial gradient, which poses some challenges to the scenario in which the bulge would result solely from the vertical heating of the bar.

	Abstract = {Context. The Galactic bulge is a massive, old component of the Milky Way. It is known to host a bar, and it has recently been demonstrated to have a pronounced boxy/peanut structure in its outer region. Several independent studies suggest the presence of more than one stellar populations in the bulge, with different origins and a relative fraction changing across the bulge area.  Aims: This is the first of a series of papers presenting the results of the Giraffe Inner Bulge Survey, carried out at the ESO-VLT with the multifibre spectrograph FLAMES. Spectra of ~5000 red clump giants in 24 bulge fields have been obtained at resolution R = 6500, in the infrared Calcium triplet wavelength region at ~8500 {\AA}. They are used to derive radial velocities and metallicities, based on new calibration specifically devised for this project. Radial velocities for another ~1200 bulge red clump giants, obtained from similar archive data, have been added to the sample. Higher resolution spectra have been obtained for ~450 additional stars at latitude b = -3.5, with the aim of investigating chemical abundance patterns variations with longitude, across the inner bulge. In total we present here radial velocities for 6392 red clump stars.  Methods: We present here the target selection criteria, observing strategy and the catalog with radial velocity measurements for all the target stars.  Results: We derive a radial velocity, and velocity dispersion map of the Milky Way bulge, useful to be compared with similar maps of external bulges, and to infer the expected velocities and dispersion at any line of sight. The K-type giants kinematics is consistent with the cylindrical rotation pattern of M-giants from the BRAVA survey. Our sample enables to extend this result to latitude b = -2, closer to the Galactic plane than probed by previous surveys. Finally, we find strong evidence for a velocity dispersion peak at (0, -1) and (0, -2), possibily indicative of a high density peak in the central ~250 pc of the bulge.

	Abstract = {We present the kinematic results from our ARGOS spectroscopic survey of the Galactic bulge of the Milky Way. Our aim is to understand the formation of the Galactic bulge. We examine the kinematics of about 17 400 stars in the bulge located within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic Centre, identified from the 28 000 star ARGOS survey. We aim to determine if the formation of the bulge has been internally driven from disc instabilities as suggested by its boxy shape, or if mergers have played a significant role as expected from lambda cold dark matter simulations. From our velocity measurements across latitudes b = -5$\,^{\circ}$, - 7.5$\,^{\circ}$ and -10$\,^{\circ}$ we find the bulge to be a cylindrically rotating system that transitions smoothly out into the disc. From observations of 3 fields at b = +10, the kinematics of the bulge show North-South symmetry about the major axis. Within the bulge, we find a kinematically distinct metal-poor population ([Fe/H] < -1.0) that is not rotating cylindrically. The 5 per cent of our stars with [Fe/H] < -1.0 are a slowly rotating spheroidal population, which we believe are stars of the metal-weak thick disc and halo which presently lie in the inner Galaxy. The kinematics of the two bulge components that we identified in ARGOS Paper III (mean [Fe/H] ≈ -0.25 and [Fe/H] ≈ +0.15, respectively) demonstrate that they are likely to share a common formation origin and are distinct from the more metal-poor populations of the thick disc and halo which are co-located inside the bulge. We do not exclude an underlying merger generated bulge component but our results favour bulge formation from instabilities in the early thin disc.},

	Abstract = {We present a simple and efficient anisotropic generalization of the semi-isotropic (two-integral) axisymmetric Jeans formalism, which is used to model the stellar kinematics of galaxies. The following is assumed: (i) a constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and (ii) a velocity ellipsoid that is aligned with cylindrical coordinates (R, z) and characterized by the classic anisotropy parameter . Our simple models are fit to SAURON integral-field observations of the stellar kinematics for a set of fast-rotator early-type galaxies. With only two free parameters (betaz and the inclination), the models generally provide remarkably good descriptions of the shape of the first (V) and second () velocity moments, once a detailed description of the surface brightness is given. This is consistent with previous findings on the dynamical structure of these objects. With the observationally motivated assumption that betaz >~ 0, the method is able to recover the inclination. The technique can be used to determine the dynamical M/L and angular momenta of early-type fast-rotators and spiral galaxies, especially when the quality of the data does not justify more sophisticated modelling approaches. This formalism allows for the inclusion of dark matter, supermassive black holes, spatially varying anisotropy and multiple kinematic components.},

@article{Conroy13,
	Abstract = {Several independent lines of evidence suggest that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies becomes increasingly "bottom-heavy" with increasing galaxy mass and/or velocity dispersion, sigma. Here we consider evidence for IMF variation in a sample of relatively compact early-type galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These galaxies are of sufficiently high stellar density that a dark halo likely makes a minor contribution to the total dynamical mass, M dyn, within one effective radius. We fit our detailed stellar population synthesis models to the stacked absorption line spectra of these galaxies in bins of sigma and find evidence from IMF-sensitive spectral features for a bottom-heavy IMF at high sigma. We also apply simple "mass-follows-light" dynamical models to the same data and find that M dyn is significantly higher than what would be expected if these galaxies were stellar dominated and had a universal Milky Way IMF. Adopting M dyn ≈ M * therefore implies that the IMF is "heavier" at high sigma. Most importantly, the quantitative amount of inferred IMF variation is very similar between the two techniques, agreeing to within <~ 0.1 dex in mass. The agreement between two independent techniques, when applied to the same data, provides compelling evidence for systematic variation in the IMF as a function of early-type galaxy velocity dispersion. Any alternative explanations must reproduce both the results from dynamical and stellar population-based techniques.},

@article{Geha13,
	Abstract = {We present constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in two ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, Hercules and Leo IV, based on deep Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging. The Hercules and Leo IV galaxies are extremely low luminosity (MV = -6.2, -5.5), metal-poor (lang[Fe/H]rang = -2.4, -2.5) systems that have old stellar populations (>11 Gyr). Because they have long relaxation times, we can directly measure the low-mass stellar IMF by counting stars below the main-sequence turnoff without correcting for dynamical evolution. Over the stellar mass range probed by our data, 0.52-0.77 M &sun;, the IMF is best fit by a power-law slope of \alpha = 1.2_{-0.5}^{+0.4} for Hercules and alpha = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.8 for Leo IV. For Hercules, the IMF slope is more shallow than a Salpeter (alpha = 2.35) IMF at the 5.8sigma level, and a Kroupa (alpha = 2.3 above 0.5 M &sun;) IMF slope at 5.4sigma level. We simultaneously fit for the binary fraction, f binary, finding f_binary = 0.47^{+0.16}_{-0.14} for Hercules, and 0.47^{+0.37}_{-0.17} for Leo IV. The UFD binary fractions are consistent with that inferred for Milky Way stars in the same mass range, despite very different metallicities. In contrast, the IMF slopes in the UFDs are shallower than other galactic environments. In the mass range 0.5-0.8 M &sun;, we see a trend across the handful of galaxies with directly measured IMFs such that the power-law slopes become shallower (more bottom-light) with decreasing galactic velocity dispersion and metallicity. This trend is qualitatively consistent with results in elliptical galaxies inferred via indirect methods and is direct evidence for IMF variations with galactic environment.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at STScI, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Bell01,
	Abstract = {We have used a suite of simplified spectrophotometric spiral galaxy evolution models to argue that there are substantial variations in stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios within and among galaxies, amounting to factors of between 3 and 7 in the optical and factors of 2 in the near-infrared. Our models show a strong correlation between stellar M/L and the optical colors of the integrated stellar populations. Under the assumption of a universal spiral galaxy initial mass function (IMF), relative trends in model stellar M/L with color are robust to uncertainties in stellar population and galaxy evolution modeling, including the effects of modest bursts of star formation. Errors in the dust-reddening estimates do not strongly affect the final derived stellar masses of a stellar population. We examine the observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios of a sample of spiral galaxies with accurate rotation curves and optical and near-infrared luminosity profiles. From these observed maximum disk M/L ratios we conclude that a Salpeter IMF has too many low-mass stars per unit luminosity but that an IMF similar to the Salpeter IMF at the high-mass end with less low-mass stars (giving stellar M/L ratios 30% lower than the Salpeter value) is consistent with the maximum disk constraints. Trends in observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios with color provide a good match to the predicted model relation, suggesting that the spiral galaxy stellar IMF is universal and that a fraction of (particularly high surface brightness) spiral galaxies may be close to maximum disk. We apply the model trends in stellar M/L ratio with color to the Tully-Fisher (T-F) relation. We find that the stellar mass T-F relation is relatively steep, has modest scatter, and is independent of the passband and color used to derive the stellar masses, again lending support for a universal IMF. The difference in slope between the optical (especially blue) and near-infrared T-F relations is due to the combined effects of dust attenuation and stellar M/L variations with galaxy mass. Assuming the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project distance to the Ursa Major Cluster and neglecting the (uncertain) molecular gas fraction, we find that the baryonic T-F relation takes the form Mbaryon~V3.5 (with random and systematic 1 sigma slope errors of ~0.2 each) when using a bisector fit and rotation velocities derived from the flat part of the rotation curve. Since we have normalized the stellar M/L ratios to be as high as can possibly be allowed by maximum disk constraints, the slope of the baryonic T-F relation will be somewhat shallower than 3.5 if all disks are substantially submaximal.},

	Abstract = {We use the relations between aperture stellar velocity dispersion (sigmaap), stellar mass (MSPS) and galaxy size (Re) for a sample of ˜150 000 early-type galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey/DR7 to place constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and dark halo response to galaxy formation. We build lambda cold dark matter-based mass models that reproduce, by construction, the relations between galaxy size, light concentration and stellar mass, and use the spherical Jeans equations to predict sigmaap. Given our model assumptions (including those in the stellar population synthesis models), we find that reproducing the median sigmaap versus MSPS relation is not possible with both a universal IMF and a universal dark halo response. Significant departures from a universal IMF and/or dark halo response are required, but there is a degeneracy between these two solutions. We show that this degeneracy can be broken using the strength of the correlation between residuals of the velocity-mass (Deltalog sigmaap) and size-mass (Deltalog Re) relations. The slope of this correlation, ∂VR ≡ Deltalog sigmaap/Deltalog Re, varies systematically with galaxy mass from ∂VR ~= -0.45 at MSPS ˜ 1010 M&sun; to ∂VR ~= -0.15 at MSPS ˜ 1011.6 M&sun;. The virial Fundamental Plane (FP) has ∂VR = -1/2, and thus we find that the tilt of the observed FP is mass dependent. Reproducing this tilt requires both a non-universal IMF and a non-universal halo response. Our best model has mass-follows-light at low masses (MSPS ≲ 1011.2 M&sun;) and unmodified Navarro, Frenk and White haloes at MSPS ˜ 1011.5 M&sun;. The stellar masses imply a mass-dependent IMF which is `lighter' than Salpeter at low masses and `heavier' than Salpeter at high masses.},

	Abstract = {We study the mass and anisotropy distribution of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 5846 using stars, as well as the red and blue globular cluster (GC) subpopulations. We break degeneracies in the dynamical models by taking advantage of the different phase space distributions of the two GC subpopulations to unambiguously constrain the mass of the galaxy and the anisotropy of the GC system. Red GCs show the same spatial distribution and behaviour as the starlight, whereas blue GCs have a shallower density profile, a larger velocity dispersion and a lower kurtosis, all of which suggest a different orbital distribution. We use a dispersion-kurtosis Jeans analysis and find that the solutions of separate analyses for the two GC subpopulations overlap in the halo parameter space. The solution converges on a massive dark matter halo, consistent with expectations from Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) and 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) cosmology in terms of virial mass (log MDM ˜ 13.3 M&sun;) and concentration (cvir ˜ 8). This is the first such analysis that solves the dynamics of the different GC subpopulations in a self-consistent manner. Our method improves the uncertainties on the halo parameter determination by a factor of 2 and opens new avenues for the use of elliptical galaxy dynamics as tests of predictions from cosmological simulations. The implied stellar mass-to-light ratio derived from the dynamical modelling is fully consistent with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and rules out a bottom light IMF. The different GC subpopulations show markedly distinct orbital distributions at large radii, with red GCs having an anisotropy parameter beta˜0.4 outside ˜ 3 Re (Re is the effective radius), and the blue GCs having beta˜0.15 at the same radii, while centrally ( ˜ 1 Re) they are both isotropic. We discuss the implications of our findings within the two-phase formation scenario for early-type galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal or is instead sensitive to environmental conditions is of critical importance: The IMF influences most observable properties of stellar populations and thus galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide deep insights into the star formation process. This review critically examines reports of IMF variations, with a view toward whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a universal system IMF: a power law of Salpeter index (Gamma = 1.35) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power law (Gamma ˜ 0-0.25) for lower mass stars. The shape and universality of the substellar IMF is still under investigation. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a universal IMF, suggesting no gross variations over much of cosmic time. Indications of ``nonstandard'' IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments clearly warrant further study. However, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars.},

	Abstract = {A sample numerical model has been computed for a triaxial stellar system in dynamical equilibrium. A four-step procedure was employed. (1) A density distribution with a modified Hubble profile - to approximate elliptical galaxies - and axis ratios of 1:25:2 was chosen. This figure was further chosen not to rotate. (2) The potential corresponding to the chosen density distribution was computed. (3) About 1500 orbits were computed with this potential, one at a time, each covering typically 100 oscillations through the system; i.e., about 1 billion years. These orbits belong to two families, viz., box orbits and tube orbits around the long axis of the system. (4) A reproduction of the chosen density distribution - in terms of its mass in 285 cells in each octant - was sought by superposition of a subset of the available orbits, each populated by an appropriate nonnegative number of stars. The application of linear programming led to a numerical solution. The main results are: First, the majority of the orbits computed in step 3 turned out to have three effective integrals; i.e., two nonclassical ones in addition to the energy integral. Second, the existence of the numerical solution found in step 4 suggests the existence of triaxial self-consistent systems in dynamical equilibrium with density profiles fitting elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The ATLAS3D project is a multiwavelength survey combined with a theoretical modelling effort. The observations span from the radio to the millimetre and optical, and provide multicolour imaging, two-dimensional kinematics of the atomic (H I), molecular (CO) and ionized gas (Hbeta, [O III] and [N I]), together with the kinematics and population of the stars (Hbeta, Fe5015 and Mg b), for a carefully selected, volume-limited (1.16 × 105 Mpc3) sample of 260 early-type (elliptical E and lenticular S0) galaxies (ETGs). The models include semi-analytic, N-body binary mergers and cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here we present the science goals for the project and introduce the galaxy sample and the selection criteria. The sample consists of nearby (D < 42 Mpc, |delta- 29$\,^{\circ}$| < 35$\,^{\circ}$, |b| > 15$\,^{\circ}$) morphologically selected ETGs extracted from a parent sample of 871 galaxies (8 per cent E, 22 per cent S0 and 70 per cent spirals) brighter than MK < -21.5 mag (stellar mass M*≳ 6 ×109 M&sun;). We analyse possible selection biases and we conclude that the parent sample is essentially complete and statistically representative of the nearby galaxy population. We present the size-luminosity relation for the spirals and ETGs and show that the ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample define a tight red sequence in a colour-magnitude diagram, with few objects in the transition from the blue cloud. We describe the strategy of the SAURON integral field observations and the extraction of the stellar kinematics with the pPXF method. We find typical 1sigma errors of DeltaV≈ 6 km s-1, Deltasigma≈ 7 km s-1, Deltah3≈Deltah4≈ 0.03 in the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion and Gauss-Hermite (GH) moments for galaxies with effective dispersion sigmae≳ 120 km s-1. For galaxies with lower sigmae (≈40 per cent of the sample) the GH moments are gradually penalized by pPXF towards zero to suppress the noise produced by the spectral undersampling and only V and sigma can be measured. We give an overview of the characteristics of the other main data sets already available for our sample and of the ongoing modelling projects.},

@article{Cappellari12,
	Abstract = {Much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emitted by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination, no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies. Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal, but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way. Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS3D sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the well-known correlations between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and other global observables of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics to about one effective (half-light) radius Re. They have well-calibrated I-band Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and large-field ground-based photometry, accurate surface brightness fluctuation distances, and their observed kinematics is consistent with an axisymmetric intrinsic shape. All these factors result in an unprecedented accuracy in the M/L measurements. We find a tight correlation of the form (M/L) = (3.80 +/- 0.14) × (sigmae/200kms-1)0.84+/-0.07 between the M/L (in the I band) measured from the dynamical models and the luminosity-weighted second moment sigmae of the LOSVD within Re. The observed rms scatter in M/L for our sample is 18 per cent, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is ~13 per cent. The (M/L)-sigmae relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight correlations between sigmae and other galaxy global observables. The comparison of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the `tilt' of the FP of early-type galaxies, describing the deviation of the FP from the virial relation, is almost exclusively due to a real M/L variation, while structural and orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. When the photometric parameters are determined in the `classic' way, using growth curves, and the sigmae is measured in a large aperture, the virial mass appears to be a reliable estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies, and can be safely used where more `expensive' models are not feasible (e.g. in high-redshift studies). In this case the best-fitting virial relation has the form (M/L)vir= (5.0 +/- 0.1) ×Resigma2e/(LG), in reasonable agreement with simple theoretical predictions. We find no difference between the M/L of the galaxies in clusters and in the field. The comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)pop inferred from the analysis of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in early-type galaxies of ~30 per cent of the total mass inside one Re, in broad agreement with previous studies, and it also shows that the stellar initial mass function varies little among different galaxies. Our results suggest a variation in M/L at constant (M/L)pop, which seems to be linked to the galaxy dynamics. We speculate that fast-rotating galaxies have lower dark matter fractions than the slow-rotating and generally more-massive ones. If correct, this would suggest a connection between the galaxy assembly history and the dark matter halo structure. The tightness of our correlation provides some evidence against cuspy nuclear dark matter profiles in galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Galaxies with the mass of the Milky Way dominate the stellar mass density of the universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. Here we study progenitors of these galaxies out to z = 2.5, using data from the 3D-HST and CANDELS Treasury surveys. We find that galaxies with present-day stellar masses of log (M) ≈ 10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z = 2.5, with most of the star formation occurring before z = 1. In marked contrast to the assembly history of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to large radii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of 3.2^{+0.8}_{-0.7} between z = 2.5 and z = 1. We therefore rule out simple models in which bulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed around them. Instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks, through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. We find that after z = 1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continued to be built up, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z ~ 1 galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.},

We are using Schwarzschild's numerical orbit superposition method to reproduce in detail all kinematical and photometric observables, and recover the intrinsic orbital structure of the galaxies. Since catastrophes are the most prominent features in the orbital observables, two-dimensional kinematical coverage is essential to constrain the dynamical models.},

@article{Schlegel98,
	Abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mu m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mu m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mu m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mu m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mu m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mu m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mu m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mu m (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mu m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},
