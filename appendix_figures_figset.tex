The velocity range of integration is given by v$_{\rm blue}$/v$_{\rm red}$ in Table~\ref{tab:outflows}and the contours go from $5$ to $50\sigma$ in steps of 5$\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the RMS error in the integrated map. Symbols are the same as Figure~\ref{fig:stamp}. The right panel shows the mass spectrum with fit, where $\sigma$ is the RMS error in the integrated map.
