\begin{abstract}
We identify 45 protostellar outflows in CO maps of the Orion A giant molecular cloud from the CARMA-NRO Orion survey. Our sample includes \textcolor{red}{\numnew{}} newly detected outflows and many previously known ones. We measure the mass and energetics of outflows, including material at low-velocities by correcting for cloud contributions. \textcolor{red}{The total momentum injected by the outflows is sufficient to maintain cloud turbulence.} We compare the outflow position angles to the orientation of C$^{18}$ filaments. We find that the full sample of outflows is consistent with being randomly oriented with respect to the filamentary structure. A subsample of the most reliable measurements shows a moderate perpendicular outflow-filament alignment which may reflect accretion of mass across the filament and down to the protostellar core.  %How many are newly identified?%

\section{Observations}

\subsection{CO Maps}
The CARMA-NRO Orion survey combines interferometric observations from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) with single-dish observations from the 45 m telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO). The combination of interferometric and single-dish observations result in an unprecedented spatial dynamic range of 0.015 - 15 pc in the Orion A molecular cloud.

We use the \co[12](1-0), \co[13](1-0), and C$^{18}$O(1-0) data first presented in \citet{Kong18}. The \co[12]{} data have a resolution of $10\arcsec\times8\arcsec$ and velocity resolution of $0.25$ \kms{}. The original \co[13] data have a resolution of $8\arcsec\times6\arcsec$ and a velocity resolution of $0.22$ \kms{}, but we smooth the \co[13]{} data to match the resolution of \co[12]{}. The C$^{18}$O data have a resolution of $10\arcsec\times8\arcsec$ and a velocity resolution of $0.22$ \kms{}.

\subsection{Source Catalogs}
We primarily use the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey \citep[HOPS;][]{Furlan16} to assign driving sources to outflow emission. The HOPS catalog is the result of \emph{Herschel} PACS 70-160$\micron{}$ observations of the protostars identified in \emph{Spitzer} observations by \citet{Megeath12}. \citet{Furlan16} fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of these 330 protostars from 1.2-870$\micron{}$ with models to derive a variety of protostar, disk, and envelope properties.

We also use the study of H$_2$ outflows by \citet{Davis09} to guide our search. \citet{Davis09} carried out a search for outflows in Orion A using narrow-band images of the ro-vibrational H$_2$ 2.122 \micron{} line. Their work builds on previous H$_2$ mapping by \citet{Stanke02}. We search for outflows around the 17 sources of H$_2$ flows that are not in the HOPS catalog. In addition to the driving sources of H$_2$ outflows, \citet{Davis09} catalog H$_2$ features with no obvious driving source. We also search for the CO counterpart to the 29 H$_2$ flows without an identified source within the CO data footprint. \citet{Davis09} measure the proper motions of 33 flows. We use the $H_2$ images and, when available, the proper motions to help assign assign especially difficult CO outflows to driving sources.

\subsection{Other Outflow Studies}
Orion A has been mapped extensively in CO over the past 30 years \citep[e.g.][]{Bally87,Wilson05,Shimajiri11,Buckle12,Ripple13,Berne14}. Several studies have carried out outflow searches in the cloud using CO observations. In the northern part of the cloud, previous searches have identified identified 18 outflows along the OMC 2/3 ridge \citep{Chini97,Aso00,Williams03,Takahashi08,Shimajiri08,Shimajiri09}. In the L1641N cluster in the southern part of the cloud, \citet{Stanke07} and \citet{Nakamura12} found six outflows. In the NGC 1999 region further south, previous studies have found five outflows \citep{Morgan91,Moro-Martin99,Davis2000,Choi17}. 

\citet{Tanabe:submitted} have carried out a systematic search for outflows across the Orion A cloud, using the same single-dish NRO observations which are used in our CARMA-NRO Orion survey. They identify a total of 44 outflows across the cloud, including 17 new detections. Eleven of these are in the OMC 4/5 region where no outflows had previously been found. Although we expect our catalog to largely overlap with \citet{Tanabe:submitted}, they use an automated outflow search procedure which risks including false positives. We describe our procedure for identifying outflows below.

\section{Outflow Identification}
%\lipsum[4-5]
\label{sec:identification}
We search for CO outflows around every HOPS protostar in the \citet{Furlan16} and every source of an H$_2$ jet in \citet{Davis09}. For each source, first fit an average \co[12] spectrum with a gaussian. Next, we integrate the \co[12] emission 2$\sigma$ away from the mean velocity on either side. We inspect the contour maps of the blue-shifted and red-shifted emission to look for collimated structures detected above $5\sigma$ centered on the candidate source.

In addition to the \co[12]{} blue/red contour maps, we use NIR images from the VISTA survey \citep{Meingast16} and the H$_2$ outflows in \citet{Davis09} to guide our assignment of high-velocity CO to driving sources. These ancillary data are especially useful in areas of overlapping outflows, or where outflow lobes are spatially removed from the driving source. When a series of H$_2$ bow shocks or NIR nebulosity which are clearly associated with a particular source overlap a region of high-velocity CO emission, we can be more confident in the assignment of this CO outflow to its source.

\citet{Tanabe:submitted} automatically defines any blue or redshifted emission above $5\sigma$ near a protostar as an outflow. By restricting our catalog to structures that have the expected morphology, or are correlated with H$_2$ flows, we limit the risk of false positives. Several of the outflows in \citet{Tanabe:submitted} are not included here for these reasons (see Table~\ref{tab:outflows}).

Some regions (e.g. OMC 2/3) contain several overlapping outflows. In these cases, we try to follow previous authors' assignment of the high-velocity emission, unless we strongly disagree with their assessment. In Section~\ref{sec:extraction}, we describe the outflow region extraction.

Once we have identified an outflow, we adjust the velocity range over which we integrate \co[12]{} to produce contour maps that most clearly separate the blue/red lobes from surrounding cloud emission. Table~\ref{tab:outflows} lists these visually determined velocities ($v_{\rm blue}$ and $v_{\rm red}$).

For each outflow, we determine a confidence rating of "Definite" or "Marginal". Definite outflows are clearly associated with their driving source, are clearly distinct from surrounding outflows and cloud emission, and are often clearly correlated with H$_2$ outflows. Most definite outflows have been identified previously. Marginal outflows either have an unclear source assignment, are not clearly separated from the cloud or overlapping outflow emission, or are simply very weakly detected. In some cases, we are more confident of either the blue or red outflow lobe, so we assign confidence ratings independently to each. We expect the subset of definite outflows will have more reliable physical properties and position angles (see Section~\ref{sec:physics}.

While many studies have identified energetic outflows in the OMC 1 region \citep[e.g.][]{Schmid-Burgk90,Zapata05,Teixeira16,Bally17}, we avoid this region in our outflow search. Neither \citet{Davis09} nor \citet{Furlan16} cover the central part of the Orion Nebula, due to saturation and confusion with the bright nebulosity in this region. Aside from the lack of good source catalogs in this region, the CO velocity dispersion in OMC-1 is up to 100~km~s$^{-1}$, due to the BN/KL ``explosion'' \citep{Bally17}, making it hard to define blue/red outflow lobes. Thus, in this study we focus our outflow search outside of this region. 

In total, we identify 45 outflows with 67 individual blue/red lobes. Of these, 11 were not identified by \citet{Tanabe:submitted}. We do not detect 10 of the outflows included in \citet{Tanabe:submitted}. Most of these non-detections consist of the most dubious outflows in that study, which we suspect are spurious due to the automated identification method they use. Of the 67 outflow lobes, we classify 38 as ``definite'' and 29 as ``marginal''. Table~\ref{tab:outflows} lists the source, location, $v_{\rm blue}$/$v_{\rm red}$, confidence score, and the corresponding outflow in \citet{Tanabe:submitted} for our entire catalog.

Figure~\ref{fig:stamp} shows the outflow in OMC~2 driven by \example{}. This outflow is well-known in the literature (Outflow 12 in \citealp{Tanabe:submitted} and $FIR 2$ in \citealp{Takahashi08}). We use this outflow in Figures~\ref{fig:c18o_fit}-\ref{fig:filament} to demonstrate our methods for calculating the properties of the outflows. We present the entire outflow catalog in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix}.

\section{Physical Properties of Outflows}\label{sec:physics}
\subsection{Calculating Physical Properties}
To calculate the physical properties of outflows, we adapt the methods described by \citet{Arce01}, \citet{Dunham14}, and \citet{ZhangY16}.
\subsubsection{Extracting Outflow Emission}\label{sec:extraction}
To measure the outflow mass, we must first extract each outflow from the surrounding cloud. This is particularly difficult in Orion, where many outflows are clustered and overlapping. We use a two-step approach to extract each outflow lobe.

First, we integrate the $^{12}$CO cube over the visually estimated velocity range of the outflow lobe (\textcolor{red}{discussed in Section~\ref{sec:identification}}). We select pixels above $5\sigma$ in this integrated map of high-velocity emission, excluding insignificant noise from the outflow. Next, we draw a region around each outflow lobe by hand to remove other overlapping outflows or other cloud structures in the area. %Maybe mention some especially difficult cases of outflows to extract? And compare to how tanabe does it?

To summarize, those pixels above $5\sigma$ in integrated high-velocity $^{12}$CO and which are visually inside the outflow are included in determining the physical properties of the outflow. Figure~\ref{fig:stamp} shows the regions extracted for the \example{} outflow. The regions extracted for the other outflows are shown in the Appendix. 

\subsubsection{Systemic Velocity}\label{sec:vsys}
To calculate outflow energetics, we need to know the systemic velocity $v_{\rm sys}$ of the outflow source. We use the CARMA-NRO Orion C$^{18}$O data \citep{Kong18} for this purpose. We fit a gaussian model to the average C$^{18}$O spectrum within a 15\arcsec{} radius around the outflow source and define the mean of this gaussian to be $v_{\rm sys}$. In most cases, there is only one significant velocity component in the C$^{18}$O spectrum. In the few outflows where multiple velocity components are detected, we adopt the velocity of the most significant component as $v_{\rm sys}$. Figure~\ref{fig:c18o_fit} shows the C$^{18}$O spectrum and fit for the \example{} outflow.

\caption{C$^{18}$O spectrum of the \example{} outflow. The black line shows the average C$^{18}$O spectrum within a radius of 15\arcsec around \example{}. The green line is a gaussian fit to the spectrum. We define the mean of this fit to be $v_{\rm sys}$ (see Section~\ref{sec:vsys}). \label{fig:c18o_fit}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Excitation Temperature}\label{sec:tex}
We estimate the excitation temperature of $^{12}$CO, \tex, using the equation from \citet{Rohlfs96}, which assume $^{12}$CO is optically thick in the line core:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Tex}
T_{\rm ex} = \frac{5.53}{ln(1 + [5.53/(T_{\rm peak} + 0.82)])}.
\end{equation}

We define $T_{\rm peak}$ for each outflow to be the peak temperature of the average $^{12}$CO spectrum toward the outflow area defined in Section~\ref{sec:extraction}. Figure~\ref{fig:tex} shows the average $^{12}$CO spectrum with $T_{\rm peak}$ indicated for the \example{} outflow.

\caption{\co[12]{} spectrum of the \example{} outflow. The black line shows the average \co[12]{} spectrum within the outflow mask shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stamp}. We use the peak of this spectrum, $T_{\rm peak}$, to calculate \tex{} (see Section~\ref{sec:tex}). \label{fig:tex}}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{$^{12}$CO Opacity Correction}\label{sec:opacity}
In Orion, \co[12]{} is usually optically thick \citep{Kong18}. Therefore, if we do not correct for opacity we may miss a substantial amount of outflow mass. By comparing to more optically thin tracers, studies have long shown that outflows tend to be optically thick in \co[12]{}, at least at lower velocities \citep[e.g.,][]{Goldsmith84,Arce01}. \citet{Dunham14} find that correcting for the optical depth of outflows increases their mass by a factor of 3 on average. Despite this, outflow studies that lack an optically thin tracer often assume that all outflow emission is optically thin \citep[e.g. in Orion,][]{Morgan91,Takahashi08}. 

\citet{Tanabe:submitted} adopt an average \co[12]{} optical depth of 5 for their entire outflow catalog. They apply this constant correction factor to every velocity channel. But \citet{Dunham14} show that the optical depth varies with velocity: optical depth decreases with increasing velocity away from the cloud core. We follow \citet{Dunham14} and \citet{ZhangY16} and use the ratio of $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO to derive a velocity-dependent opacity correction for each outflow.

We assume both \co[12]{} and \co[13]{} are in LTE with the same excitation temperature and \co[13]{} is optically thin. Then the ratio between the two isotopes is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Tratio}
\frac{T_{\rm \co[12]}}{T_{\rm \co[13]}} = \frac{[\rm{\co[12]}]}{[\rm{\co[13]}]} \frac{1 - e^{-\tau_{12}}}{\tau_{12}},
\end{equation}
where we assume the abundance ratio [\co[12]]/[\co[13]] is 62 \citep{Langer93} and $\tau_{12}$ is the optical depth of \co[12]{}. We calculate the mean ratio between \co[12]{} and \co[13]{} spectra in each outflow region, only including voxels with both \co[12]{} and \co[13]{} detected at $5\sigma$. 

\co[13]{} is usually too weak to detect more than 2-3 \kms{} away from the line core. Thus we extrapolate the measured ratio spectrum by fitting it with a 2nd-order polynomial, weighting each velocity channel by the standard deviation of the ratio in that channel. For each velocity, we use the value of this fit and Equation \ref{eq:Tratio} to calculate the correction factor $\tau_{12}$/(1 - $e^{-\tau_{12}}$) with which we multiply the observed \co[12]{}. Because the opacity correction factor cannot be less than one for any value of $\tau_{12}$, the ratio spectrum fit is capped at the value of [\co[12]]/[\co[13]] and here we consider \co[12]{} optically thin.

In Figure~\ref{fig:opacity}, we show an example of the \co[12]{}/\co[13]{} ratio spectrum and fit for the \example{} outflow. 

\begin{figure}
% \epsscale{0.6}
\plotone{opacity_correct.pdf}
\caption{\co[12]{}/\co[13]{} ratio of the \example{} outflow. The black points are the ratio between the average \co[12]{} and \co[13]{} spectrum in the outflow region, where both lines are detected at $5\sigma$. The error bars indicate the standard deviation of the ratio. The green parabola is the best weighted least-squares fit to the ratio. The solid line shows the fitting range used, while the dotted line is an extrapolation of this fit. The parabola is capped at the assumed isotopic ratio of 62 (see Section~\ref{sec:opacity}).\label{fig:opacity}}
\end{figure}

%%%% DISCUSS THE MASS SPECTRUM, MAYBE BEFORE THE LOW-VELOCITY SECTION?
\subsubsection{Outflow Mass}\label{sec:dmdv}
After correcting for opacity, we use the \co[12]{} emission to calculate the H$_2$ column density in each velocity channel. From Equation A6 in \citet{ZhangY16},

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dNdv}
\frac{dN}{dv} = \left(\frac{8\pi k \nu^2_{ul}}{h c^3 A_{ul} g_u}\right) Q_{\rm rot}(T_{\rm ex})~ e^{E_u / kT_{\rm ex}} \frac{T_R(v)}{f}
\end{equation}
where $\nu_{ul} = 115.271$ GHz is the frequency of the \co[12](1-0) transition, $A_{ul} = 7.203 \times 10^{-8}$~s$^{-1}$ is the Einstein A coefficient, $E_u/k = 5.53$~K is the energy of the upper level, $g_u = 3$ is the degeneracy of the upper level, $Q_{\rm rot}$ is the partition function (calculated to $j=100$), $T_{\rm ex}$ is the excitation temperature defined in Section~\ref{sec:tex}, $T_R(v)$ is the opacity-corrected brightness temperature of \co[12]{}, and $f$ is the abundance ratio of 
\co[12]/H$_{2}$. We assume an abundance ratio of $f = 1 \times 10 ^{-4}$ \citep{Frerking82}.

We then calculate the mass in each voxel:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mass}
M = \mu_{\rm H_2} m_{\rm H} A_{\rm pixel} N_{\rm H_2},
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\rm H_2} = 2.8$ is the mean molecular weight of H$_2$ \citep{Kauffmann08}, $m_{\rm H} = 1.674 \times 10^{-24}$~g is the mass of the hydrogen atom, and $A_{\rm pixel} = 1.6 \times 10^{-5}$~pc$^2$ is the spatial area subtended by each pixel at the distance of the cloud. In blue (red) outflow lobes we sum the total mass in each velocity channel blueward (redward) of $v_{\rm sys}$ and arrive at the outflow mass spectrum $dM/dv$. We only consider pixels above $3\sigma$ and within their respective outflow lobe region in this mass calculation. Figure~\ref{fig:dmdv} shows an example mass spectrum for the \example{} outflow.

The total mass of each outflow lobe is obtained by integrating the mass spectrum over the relevant velocity range. For a lower limit on the mass, we consider only the high-velocity component: those velocity channels farther from $v_{\rm sys}$ than the visually determined outflow velocity (Section~\ref{sec:identification}). These velocities were chosen to include as much outflow emission as possible while avoiding contamination by the main cloud. However, if we only consider this high-velocity outflow material, we may miss a significant fraction of the total mass.

\begin{figure}
% \epsscale{0.6}
\plotone{dmdv.pdf}
\caption{Mass spectrum of the \example{} outflow. The blue (red) lines show the opacity-corrected mass spectrum in the blue (red) lobe region. The black dashed lines are gaussian fits to these mass spectra. The dark blue (dark red) shaded regions indicate the region integrated to get the high-velocity mass. The light blue (light red) shaded regions show the low-velocity mass after subtracting the cloud mass spectrum fit (see Section~\ref{sec:dmdv}).\label{fig:dmdv}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Low-Velocity Outflow Emission}\labe{sec:lowvelocity}
Outflows are conspicuous because of their high-velocity emission. But outflows also exist at lower velocities. \citet{Dunham14} note that escape velocities from protostars can be as low as 0.1 \kms. As these speeds are much lower than typical cloud CO line-widths, this low-velocity outflow material is often difficult to disentangle from the host molecular cloud.

The low-velocity contribution to the total outflow mass can be quite significant. \citet{Dunham14} found that adding the inferred low-velocity emission increased the mass of outflows by a factor of 7.7 on average, with some outflows increasing by an order of magnitude or more. Outflow momentum and energy increased by factors of 3 to 5, on average. \citet{Offner11} found that high-velocity outflow emission underestimated the total outflow mass by a factor of 5 in synthetic observations of simulated outflows. Clearly, low-velocity emission should be accounted for when assessing the absolute impact of outflows on the cloud. We describe our method, adapted from \citet{Dunham14} for recovering this low-velocity outflow mass below. 

For each outflow lobe, we fit the opacity-corrected mass spectrum with a gaussian. For 'low' velocities between $v_{\rm sys}$ and the visually determined outflow velocity ($v_{\rm blue}$ or $v_{\rm red}$), we subtract this gaussian fit from the mass spectrum and define any excess mass as low-velocity outflow mass. To reduce the amount of extraneous cloud mass introduced with this method, we exclude all velocity channels within 1 \kms{} of $v_{\rm sys}$. Figure~\ref{sec:dmdv} demonstrates this procedure for the \example{} outflow. 

Generally, the low-velocity outflow mass is significantly greater than the mass at high velocities. Because this method assumes the cloud mass spectrum is fit well by a gaussian, we expect that the low-velocity mass will often be contaminated by ambient cloud material. Thus, for each outflow lobe, we consider the high-velocity outflow mass to be a lower limit and the high-velocity plus low-velocity outflow mass to be an upper limit on the total outflow lobe mass. We report these mass ranges for each outflow lobe in Table~\ref{tab:physics}.

\subsubsection{Momentum and Kinetic Energy}

We define the momentum per velocity channel to be $dP/dv = (dM/dv) v_{\rm out}$, where $dM/dv$ is the mass spectrum discussed in Section~\ref{sec:dmdv} and $v_{\rm out}$ is the velocity relative to $v_{\rm sys}$. Similarly, the kinetic energy per velocity channel is $dE/dv = (1/2) (dM/dv)  v_{\rm out}^2$. We sum the momentum and kinetic energy separately for low velocities, with the ambient cloud corrected mass spectrum, and high velocities. In Table~\ref{tab:physics}, we report the momentum and kinetic energy of each outflow lobe.

\subsubsection{Dynamical Time}\label{sec:tdyn}
We use the same method as \citet{Curtis10} to estimate the dynamical time $t_{\rm dyn}$ of each outflow lobe. Assuming the outflow has been expanding uniformly at the same velocity since it was launched, $t_{\rm dyn} = R / v_{\rm max}$, where $R$ is the length of the outflow and $v_{\rm max}$ is the maximum outflow velocity. We define $R$ to be the projected distance from the outflow source to the farthest part of the outflow lobe and $v_{\rm max}$ as the greatest velocity relative to $v_{\rm sys}$ where \co[12]{} is detected at $3\sigma$. Some outflows are detectable all the way to the limits of the \co[12]{} spectral coverage (-2~\kms{} in the blue, 20~\kms{} in the red). In these cases, $v_{\rm max}$ is a lower limit, as are the mass and mass-derived properties. Figure~\ref{fig:vmax} shows our determination of $v_{\max}$ for the \example{} outflow. We report $R$, $v_{\max}$, and $t_{\rm dyn}$, for each outflow lobe in Table~\ref{tab:physics}.

\begin{figure}
% \epsscale{0.6}
\plotone{vmax.pdf}
\caption{Maximum velocity of the \example{} outflow. The blue (red) lines show the mean \co[12]{} spectrum in the blue (red) lobe regions. The blue (red) dotted line marks the maximum blue (red) outflow velocity, defined as the first channel where \co[12]{} is not detected at $3\sigma$ (see Section~\ref{sec:tdyn}).\label{fig:vmax}}
\end{figure}

We also calculate the mass loss rate, momentum injection rate, and energy injection rate by dividing the outflow mass, momentum, and kinetic energy by $t_{\rm dyn}$. \textcolor{red}{In Section~\ref{sec:impact}, we use these quantities to compare the impact of outflows on the cloud to the turbulent dissipation.}

\subsubsection{Outflow Position Angle and Opening Angles\label{sec:angles}}
Most studies estimate the outflow position angle (PA) by eye \citep[e.g.][]{Morgan91,Takahashi08,Plunkett13,Stephens17,Kong19,Tanabe:submitted}. We adopt a more reproducible and objective method to measure outflow position and opening angles (OA)  suggested by M. Dunham (2019, private communication) and modeled after the simulated outflow analysis carried out by \citet{Offner11}.

For each outflow lobe, we make an initial guess of the PA, measured counterclockwise (east) from the north celestial pole by convention. This initial guess is the angle from the outflow source to the peak of the integrated \co[12]{} over the velocity range of the outflow lobe. Then, we calculate the angle of every pixel in the outflow lobe relative to this initial guess. We fit the distribution of these angles with a gaussian and define the mean of the gaussian to be the PA of that outflow lobe. We define the opening angle of the outflow to be the full-width at quarter maximum (FWQM) of the gaussian, following the definition by \cite{Offner11}. We find this automated method does a suitable job producing a similar PA and OA to a visual determination. Furthermore, when comparing the outflow PA with with filament orientation (Section~\ref{sec:filament}), we avoid the risk of an artificial correlation produced by unintentional measurement bias. Figure~\ref{fig:angles} shows the distribution of pixel position angles and gaussian fit for the \example{} outflow.

The curves are gaussian fits to these distributions. We adopt the mean of each lobe as the position angle and the full-width at quarter maximum as the opening angle (see Section~\ref{sec:angles}).\label{fig:angles}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Impact of Outflows on the Cloud}\label{sec:impact}
Protostellar outflows may be important in the maintenance of turbulence in clouds, at least at cluster scales \citep{Nakamura07}. The efficiency of turbulent driving by outflows is highly uncertain, depending on the transfer of momentum from outflowing gas to the cloud. To be even a plausible source of turbulence, the aggregate impact of outflows must be of a similar magnitude to the observed turbulent dissipation.

The total outflow momentum, kinetic energy, and their injection rates are given in the last row of Table~\ref{tab:physics}. We report lower and upper limits on these aggregate values by summing each outflow's high-velocity component and high-velocity + low-velocity components, respectively (see Section~\ref{sec:lowvelocity}. 

We compare the aggregate outflow impact with the cloud turbulent statistics summarized in Table 9 of \citet{Tanabe:submitted}. Using methods from \citet{Mac-Low99}, \citet{McKee07}, and \citet{Li15}, they estimate the turbulent momentum dissipation rate ($\dot P_{\rm turb}$) and kinetic energy dissipation rate ($\dot E_{\rm turb}$). Excluding the OMC~1 region, they report $\dot P_{\rm turb}= 2.83\times10^{-2}~M_\odot~\rm{km}~\rm{s}^{-1}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\dot E_{\rm turb}=1.36\times10^{34}~\rm{erg}~\rm{s}^{-1}$.

We compare these turbulent dissipation rates to the aggregate outflow injection rates in Table~\ref{tab:physics} $\dot P$ and $\dot E$. If we only account for the high-velocity outflow components, $\dot P$ is $7\%$ of $\dot P_{\rm turb}$ and $\dot E$ is $19\%$ of $\dot E_{\rm turb}$. If we add the low-velocity outflow emission, $\dot P$ is $25\%$ of $\dot P_{\rm turb}$ and $\dot E$ is $51\%$ of $\dot E_{\rm turb}$.

The outflow physical properties tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:physics} are not corrected for the inclination of outflows to the line-of-sight. Essentially, this means we assume that the radial velocity of outflow emission with respect to the source velocity is equivalent to the actual velocity of the outflowing gas. The closer an outflow is to the plane of the sky, the larger this discrepancy between observed and actual velocities. The outflow length $R_{\rm max}$, which we use to calculate $t_{\rm dyn}$ and all the derived injections rates, should also be corrected for the outflow inclination.

Because we do not know the actual inclination of each outflow, we estimate the effect of inclination on the aggregate outflow impact by assuming a constant inclination for every outflow. The mean inclination angle, assuming any orientation is equally likely, is $57.3\degr$ (where $0\degr$ is a pole-on outflow). 
\citet{Dunham14} summarize the inclination dependence of each outflow property in their Table 8. If all of the outflows are inclined $57.3\degr$, the total $\dot P$ ($\dot E$) will increase by a factor of 2.9 (5.3). Thus, after correcting for average inclination, $\dot P$ is  $20$-$72\%$ of $\dot P_{\rm turb}$ and $\dot E$ is $103$-$281\%$ of $\dot E_{\rm turb}$ (depending on whether low-velocity emission is included).

We note this inclination correction assumes that all outflow motions are along the axis of the flow, with no transverse motions. \citet{Dunham14} caution that the inclination correction factors may be significantly smaller if transverse motions are present, as demonstrated by simulations from \citet{Downes07}. The same simulations show that accounting for the \emph{atomic} component results in additional momentum and energy of about the same magnitude as the inclination corrections discussed above. While the absolute value of the outflow impacts in Orion A remains highly uncertain, it is safe to say a significant fraction of the turbulent dissipation could be offset if outflows couple efficiently to the cloud. %\citet{Offner18} finds in magnetohydrodynamic simulations that outflows can transport energy to cloud scales via magnetosonic waves. This is a potential mechanism for driving turbulence at scales larger than the typical outflow length.

\section{Outflow - Filament Alignment}\label{sec:filaments}
Outflows are ejected along the angular momentum axis of the protostellar disk. If mass accretion proceeds hierarchically, from larger scales of the cloud down to the protostellar scale, then the angular momentum axis of the protostar will trace the orientation of mass accretion flows. Protostars tend to form along narrow filaments of dense gas, and may accrete mass either along (parallel to) or across (perpendicular to) their host filaments. (CITE MOLECULAR FILAMENT PAPERS AND DESCRIBE SOMEWHERE A LITTLE ABOUT WHAT A FILAMENT ACTUALLY IS? HERE AND IN INTRO). If protostars predominately accrete mass along filaments, their outflows should be ejected perpendicular to the long axis of the filament. Conversely, if protostars accrete mostly across filaments, their outflows will be ejected parallel to the filament axis. 


In simulations, \citet{Offner16} (DESCRIBE OFFNER16 FINDINGS). \citet{Li18} (DESCRIBE LI18 FINDINGS) showed that moderately strong magnetic fields produce a perpendicular alignment between outflows and filaments.  (FIELDING15? cited by Shuo)

The alignment between CO outflows  and filaments alignment has been studied in Perseus by \citet{Stephens17} and in a massive infrared dark cloud (IRDC, \citealp{Kong19}). In Perseus, \citet{Stephens17} showed that outflows are consistent with being randomly oriented with respect to the filament, neither parallel nor perpendicular. In the IRDC G28.37+0.07, \cite{Kong19} showed that outflows are preferentially perpendicular to the filament axis. It remains to be seen whether this discrepancy arises from some meaningful difference between these clouds (e.g. evolutionary state or magnetic field strength) or by chance. 

In Orion, \citet{Davis09} showed that H$_{2}$ outflows appear randomly oriented on the sky, showing no preferential alignment to the North-South integral-shaped filament. \citet{Tanabe:submitted} studied the CO outflows in single-dish CO maps and found no evidence for alignment between outflows and the large-scale filamentary structure in the cloud. However, the filamentary structure in Orion A is more complex than a single North-South integral-shaped filament. Therefore, we use the C$^{18}$O filaments identified by \citet{Suri19} in our analysis.
%mention that stephens considers different filament lenght scales too.

\subsection{Filament Position Angles}
\citet{Suri19} apply the Discrete Persistent Structures Extractor, DisPerSE \citep{Sousbie11} to extract filaments from the C$^{18}$O spectral cube. DisPerSE connects local maxima and saddle points in the intensity distribution, which are defined as filaments. \citet{Suri19} identify a total of 625 filaments across the Orion A cloud, each of which are defined by their PPV coordinates, allowing filaments that overlap spatially to be separated in velocity space. 

For each outflow source, we search the filament catalog for the closest filament. Because most of the outflow sources are located along lines of sight with a single significant C$^{18}$O velocity component, we ignore the filament velocity information and only consider projected distance on the sky. We use cubic spline interpolation to approximate the discrete filament coordinates with a smooth curve. We used the \url{splrep} and \url{splev} functions from the \url{scipy.interpolate} package for the spline interpolation. After experimenting with the smoothing parameter $s$ to find an optimal trade-off between smoothness and goodness-of-fit, we adopt $s = 0.1\times d_{\rm min}$ where $d_{\rm min}$ is the minimum distance between the filament and outflow source.

We take the slope of the tangent to the filament curve at the closest point to the outflow source to be the position angle of the filament, which is constrained to be between $-180$ and $180\degr$. Figure~\ref{fig:filament} shows an example of the spline interpolation and tangent fitting for the closest filament to the \example{} outflow.

\caption{C$^{18}$O filament near \example{}. The black dots show the filament closes to \example{} from the \citet{Suri19} catalog. The red curve is a smooth cubic spline interpolation of the filament. The outflow source (\example{}) is marked with a black star. The blue circle shows the closest point on the filament to the source. To derive the filament position angle, we find the tangent at this nearest point, shown as a black dashed line (see Section~\ref{sec:filaments}).\label{fig:filament}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Projected Angle Between Outflows and Filaments}\label{sec:gamma}

We follow \citet{Stephens17} and \citet{Kong19} in our definition of the angular separation between outflow and filament position angles, $\gamma$. For each outflow lobe, we define $\gamma$ to be 
\begin{equation}
    \gamma = \rm{MIN}\{|\rm{PA}_{\rm out} - \rm{PA}_{\rm fil}|, 180\degr - |\rm{PA}_{\rm out} - \rm{PA}_{\rm fil}|\},
\end{equation}
where PA$_{\rm out}$ and PA$_{\rm fil}$ are the position angles of the outflow lobe and the closest filament, respectively. The value of $\gamma$ for each outflow lobe is given in Table~\ref{tab:angles}. Figure~\ref{fig:gamma_hist} shows the distribution of $\gamma$. The full sample of $\gamma$ shows no obvious clustering at either 0 or 90$\degr$.

\begin{figure}
% \epsscale{0.6}
\plotone{gamma_hist.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of projected angle between outflows and filaments. The blue histogram shows the distribution of $\gamma$ in $10\degr$ bins for the full sample of \nlobes{} outflow lobes. The orange bars show the distribution of $\gamma$ for the subsample of 38 outflow lobes with a confidence grade of "Definite" (Table~\ref{tab:outflows}). The green bars show the subsample of 37 outflow lobes whose sources are within 0.05 pc of the nearest filament (Table~\ref{tab:angles}). The red bars show the subsample of 22 outflow lobes which satisfy both of these conditions. Note that the total height of the stacked bars does not equal the size of the full sample, since the subsamples are already contained within the full sample shown in blue. \label{fig:gamma_hist}}
\end{figure}

Many of the outflows in our catalog are not as clear as our example outflow driven by \example{}. Outflows categorized as "Marginal" in Table~\ref{tab:outflows} are likely to have less reliable position angles. In these cases, we either have difficulty disentangling the high-velocity emission near these sources and/or we are unsure of which protostar is driving the outflow. Both of these factors could greatly affect the measured position angle and, by extension, $\gamma$. \citet{Stephens17} argue that the incorrect assignment of driving sources led \citet{Anathpindika08} to erroneously conclude that outflowS and filaments are perpendicular in the Perseus molecular cloud.

To test whether more reliable outflows have a different distribution of $\gamma$, we consider a subsample of outflow lobes which we consider "Definite" (Table~\ref{tab:outflows}). Figure~\ref{fig:gamma_hist} shows that these outflows are not distributed significantly differently from the full sample.

%%TALK ABOUT FILAMENT WIDTHS AND USING THE SUBSAMPLE OF MINIMUM FILAMENT DISTANCE HERE. 

Aside from the uncertainties in calculating the outflow position angles discussed above, we consider the difficulty of assigning even a well-known outflow to a particular filament. Even though we select for the closest filament to each outflow source, we cannot exclude the possibility that other nearby filaments may be important to the environment of an outflow. In particular, the OMC-4 region contains spatially overlapping filaments which are distinct in velocity space \citep{Suri19} similar to the fibers identified by \citet{Hacar13}. Thus the distribution of $\gamma$ The incorrect assignment of outflows to filaments may introduce noise to the distribution of $\gamma$ and mask an underlying correlation between outflow and filament orientations. To address this concern, we compare the full sample to the closest outflow-filament pairs. We adopt a threshold on the projected outflow-filament distance ($d_{\rm fil}$) based on the typical filament width.

\citet{Suri19} found an average filament FWHM of approximately 0.1~pc, similar to the ``characteristic'' filament width found using \emph{Herschel} dust continuum maps \citep[e.g.][]{Arzoumanian11,Koch15} However, \citet{Suri19} find a much larger spread in filament widths (about an order of magnitude around the mean). This is likely due to the fact that they allow the filament width to vary along its length, while most studies average over the entire filament length. Motivated by the mean filament width, we choose a threshold of $d_{\rm fil} \leq 0.05$~pc, which corresponds to an outflow source within the half-width at half maximum of an average filament. Figure~\ref{fig:gamma_hist} shows the distribution of $\gamma$ for this subset of outflows.

Figure~\ref{fig:gamma_hist} shows that limiting the sample to the closest outflow-filament pairs with the highest confidence reduces the fraction of outflows at projected angles of 0-30\degr{} with respect to the nearest filaments. The angles we measure are all projected on the plane of the sky. To determine whether these outflows are preferentially aligned with the filaments, we must consider the underlying distribution of deprojected $\gamma$: the outflow-filament alignment in 3D.

\subsection{Outflow-Filament Alignment}
%%%HERE, talk about the difference between projected and 3D angles, the monte-carlo simulations of random/parallel/perpendicular, the cumulative distribution functions and the Anderson-Darling tests. Compare the results of the AD tests to Stephens and Kong, as well as the more qualitative assessments in Orion by Davis09 and Tanabe.
Any outflow-filament pair can appear at any relative orientation on the plane of the sky, depending on the line-of-sight. In other words, an outflow observed perpendicular to a nearby filament may actually be parallel in space, and vice versa. Thus, we follow \citet{Stephens17} and \citet{Kong19} and run Monte Carlo simulations\footnote{See Appendix A of \citet{Stephens17} for a detailed description of the Monte Carlo simulations.} of random vector pairs to project different underlying distributions of $\gamma_{\rm 3D}$ onto the plane of the sky.

We fist generate $10^7$ pairs of unit vectors uniformly distributed around the unit sphere. From this random uniform distribution, we draw two samples. In the parallel sample, we keep only those vector pairs separated by 0-20\degr. In the perpendicular sample, we keep the pairs separated by 70-90\degr. Then, we project these vectors onto the plane of the sky by setting one coordinate to 0 and calculate the projected angle between them, $\gamma$. By comparing the distribution of the observed $\gamma$ with the random, parallel, and perpendicular models, we investigate which of these underlying scenarios is most likely given the observations.

Figure~\ref{fig:gamma_cdf} shows the cumulative distribution of $\gamma$ for the Monte Carlo simulations and each of the outflow-filament samples discussed in Section~\ref{sec:gamma}. Compared to the random distribution of $\gamma$, the outflow samples have a deficit of $\gamma < 40\degr$. In particular, the "Both" subsample with the 22 definite outflow lobes closest to their filaments contains only one lobe with $\gamma < 33\degr$ (the blue lobe of the SMZ 17 outflow) compared to the $\sim8$ which would be expected if $\gamma$ were distributed randomly.

While Figure~\ref{fig:gamma_cdf} shows that the "Parallel" scenario is inconsistent with the observed distribution of $\gamma$, the "Perpendicular" distribution is more difficult to rule out. We apply the Anderson-Darling (AD) test \citep{Stephens74} to determine if the perpendicular or random distributions can be rejected for each outflow subsample. The AD $p$-values listed in Table~\ref{tab:ad} represent the likelihood that the observed outflow-filament $\gamma$ distribution is drawn from either the random or perpendicular distribution. We do not report the results of AD tests for the parallel case; the $p$-values for the parallel distribution are all close to zero.

Based on the AD test, we reject the hypothesis that the full outflow sample is drawn from a perpendicular distribution with $>99.9\%$ confidence ($p < 0.001$), while the random distribution is not ruled out. For the definite subsample the results are similar, though we can only rule out the perpendicular distribution with $94\%$ confidence ($p = 0.06$). For the $d_{\rm fil} \leq 0.05~\rm{pc}$ subsample, we can rule out the perpendicular distribution with $98\%$ confidence ($p = 0.02$). Though these subsamples are unlikely to be drawn from a purely perpendicular distribution, their $p$-values are higher than the equivalent in \citet{Stephens17}. We do not test models with a mixture of perpendicular and parallel outflow-filament alignment, but such a bimodal distribution may be a better fit to our data than either random or perpendicular model alone.

If we limit the sample to the definite outflows with $d_{\rm fil} \leq 0.05~\rm{pc}$ ("Both"), we calculate an AD $p$-value of $> 0.25$. While we cannot rule out with better than $94\%$ confidence ($p = 0.06$) that this subsample of outflows is drawn from a random distribution, the perpendicular model more closely matches the angular distribution of these close outflow-filament pairs. We tentatively conclude that the clearest outflow-filament pairs in Orion A are perpendicularly aligned.

In Perseus, \citet{Stephens17} found a remarkably random distribution of outflow-filament angles. They argue this random alignment could reflect processes large or small scales. At large scales, the orientation of filaments may not determine the accretion of mass onto them, contradicting simulations of filament formation \citep[e.g.][]{Chen14,Clarke17}. At core scales, no matter the orientation of mass accretion, perhaps the protostellar angular momentum may be randomized by multiplicity or turbulence, as seen in simulations by \citet{Offner16} and \citet{Lee17}. Therefore, our finding of moderate perpendicular alignment between outflows and filaments in Orion A may mean that filament formation or protostellar mass accretion is different in these two environments.

In the IRDC G28, \citet{Kong19} found outflow-filament alignment consistent with being perpendicular, rejecting a random distribution at high confidence (see Table~\ref{tab:ad}). Such a strong perpendicular alignment is predicted in simulations of IRDCs by \citet{Li18} and \citet{Li19} resulting from filament formation perpendicular to a strong magnetic field and continuous mass accretion along the magnetic field lines onto protostellar cores. As IRDCs are generally considered to be in the earliest phase of massive star formation \citep{Rathborne06}, the outflow-filament alignment may evolve with evolutionary stage. A comprehensive study of $\gamma$ across many different star forming environments is necessary to answer this question.

While we find some evidence for perpendicular outflow-filament alignment in Orion A, previous studies have concluded that outflows and filaments are randomly aligned. \citet{Davis09} show that the position angles of H$_2$ jets in Orion A are distributed uniformly. They conclude that outflows are oriented randomly with respect to the $\sim$pc-scale North-South integral shaped filament. \citet{Tanabe:submitted} conclude the same using their CO outflow catalog. Our study is not directly comparable to these, as we use the C$^18$O filaments, which reveals the integral shaped filament to be made up of many smaller filamentary structures.

The results of Anderson-Darling tests between the observed and modeled distributions are in Table~\ref{tab:ad} (see Section~\ref{sec:gamma}).\label{fig:gamma_cdf}}

While we improve the specificity of the outflow-filament comparison compared to previous studies of Orion A by using the C$^{18}$O filament catalog, there is still uncertainty in pairing outflows and filaments. Future work should investigate the outflow-filament alignment over multiple length scales, and take into account the varying filament width.

The outflow-filament alignment may change as protostars evolve. A detailed comparison should be made between this alignment and protostellar properties such as bolometric temperature, multiplicity, and evolutionary stage. A combination of this sample with the studies in other clouds could provide enough statistical power to answer these more specific questions about outflow-filament alignment.
